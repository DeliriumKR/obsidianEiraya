**_Emotions._** Izek most often feels irritated, enraged, impatient, sadistic, obsessed, or bored.

**_Motivations._** Izek wants to serve the Baron faithfully—and, far more importantly, find and possess the woman he's been dreaming of.

**_Inspirations._** When playing Izek, channel Ser Gregor Clegane (Game of Thrones), Fenrir Greyback (Harry Potter), and Kratos (God of War).

**Character Information**  
**_Persona._** To the world, Izek is a cruel and brutish enforcer with a love for fire and blood.

**_Morale._** In a fight, Izek would gladly draw his silvered battleaxe and fight to the death.

**_Relationships._** Izek is the adoptive "son" of Baron Vargas Vallakovich, the captain of Vallaki's town guard, a frequent customer of the toymaker Gadof Blinsky, and (unbeknownst to either of them) the biological brother of Ireena Kolyana.
