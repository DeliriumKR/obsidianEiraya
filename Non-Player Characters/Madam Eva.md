**_Morale._** In a fight, Madam Eva would calmly insist that her opponent cease their attacks, then—if her Vistani aides prove unable to stop her assailant—weaken them with the harm spell before demanding their surrender.

**_Relationships._** Madam Eva alone knows that she is an avatar of [[The Ladies of the Fanes|the Seeker]].
