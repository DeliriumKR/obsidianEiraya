A pudgy little man named Arik Lorensk (CN male humanÂ [commoner](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#commoner_mm)) tends bar. Mindlessly, he cleans glasses, one after another. When they're all clean, he starts over. If he is spoken to, he takes orders for drinks in a dull, hollow voice. A small glass of wine costs 1 cp. A pitcher of wine costs 1 sp. After serving drinks, Arik returns to cleaning glasses. He ignores all attempts to question him.
