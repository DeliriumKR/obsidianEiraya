**Profile: Morgantha, Dream Peddler**

**Roleplaying Information**  
**_Resonance._** At the time the players meet her, Morgantha should inspire flattery and comfort with her grandmotherly charm, gratitude for her willingness to share compliments and "free samples," endearment for her complaints about the mundane trials of an old woman's life, and slight wariness of her confidence and comfort traveling alone on a dangerous road.

**_Emotions._** Morgantha most often appears to feel cheerful, amused, or thoughtful.

**_Motivations._** Morgantha wants to keep her cover, keep her business operating peacefully, make strangers feel endeared to and comfortable with her, and encourage others to try her dream pastries if they appear inclined to do so.

**_Inspirations._** Granny Weatherwax (_Discworld_), Minerva McGonagall (_Harry Potter_), Dr. Kureha (_One Piece_)

**Character Information**  
**_Persona._** To the world, Morgantha is a cheerful old lady with a love for gossip and complaining. Only Morgantha and her daughters know that she is secretly the black-hearted matron of a night hag coven.

**_Morale._** In a fight, Morgantha would attempt to parlay for peace, then use her **_etherealness_** ability to escape into the Ethereal Plane if doing so appears fruitless.

**_Relationships._** Morgantha is the mother of the **night hags** [[Bella]] and [[Offalia]], and the dream-pastry dealer for the Barovian refugee [[Franz]].
