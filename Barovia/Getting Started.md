# Adventure Hooks
---
In contrast to the original _Curse of Strahd_ module, Reloaded offers a single, original adventure hook to guide the players into Barovia. In this hook, Death House serves as a portal to [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s domain: the players enter Death House in their own world, and—upon defeating or pacifying the cult—emerge into the land of Barovia. However, this hook can be implemented in two possible ways:
## Lost in the Mists
In this version, the players are members of a mercenary adventuring party that has been hired to investigate a series of mysterious disappearances tied to a particular house (Death House). This hook focuses the players' attention solely on [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s tyranny and the Barovians who suffer under his rule, encouraging the players to immerse themselves in the campaign's lore and to develop unique relationships with its diverse cast of characters.
## Barovian Relics
In this version, one or more players possess certain unique relics that originated from Barovia and are tied to their backstories. When Death House manifests nearby, those relics are drawn to it, encouraging the players to enter and investigate. (Any players who do not wish to craft a backstory may instead choose to be a mercenary investigating recent disappearances, as in **_Lost in the Mists_**.) This hook focuses the players' attentions on their own interests and personal connections to the land of Barovia, encouraging them to invest their attention in NPCs and locations tied to their unique relics.
## Further Notes

In general, [[#Lost in the Mists]] may be viewed as a "pure" version of _Curse of Strahd_, focusing its narrative on the isolation and alienation of Barovia. By contrast, [[#Barovian Relics]] is best used by Dungeon Masters who are passionate about Barovia's gothic atmosphere and environment, but whose players require a personal connection to the campaign to be emotionally invested.

See [[Arc A - Escape from Death House]] and [[Arc A - Escape from Death House#A1. Greyhallow]] for more information about how to run these hooks. If you choose to run [[#Barovian Relics]] for one or more of your players, have each of those players choose a motivation from the [[#Motivations]] section below before beginning the campaign.

## Bonds
Your players can choose one or more bonds from the table below to weave a tapestry of connections between their characters and the ghosts of their pasts. Encourage them to re-examine and grow beyond these memories as they venture through Barovia, informing their interactions with the NPCs and narratives they encounter.

| **Bond**       | **Character History**                                                                                      |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Bitterness     | Two warring lords brought devastation to my community. I wish I could show them the cost of their war.     |
| Boundaries     | I was once pursued by an unrelenting suitor. No one should have to endure what I did.                      |
| Comparison     | My older sibling was burdened by great expectations while I was not. I think they resented me for it.      |
| Compassion     | Someone tried to steal from me once. Rather than hurting them, I helped them instead.                      |
| Concern        | One of my loved ones left home to seek their fortune. I hope they're staying safe.                         |
| Corruption     | Everyone knows that power corrupts. I've seen how firsthand.                                               |
| Determination  | My mentor was one of the few people that believed in me. I'm determined to make them proud.                |
| Devastation    | Someone once destroyed everything I cared about. I can't understand what could drive someone to such evil. |
| Devotion       | I love my family above all else. There's nothing I wouldn't do to protect them.                            |
| Dignity        | People should never be used as a means to an end. I should know.                                           |
| Division       | My family was split by a bitter feud. I still hope that they'll reconcile someday.                         |
| Empathy        | I'll never forget the sound my parents made when they learned that my sibling had died.                    |
| Faith          | I know what it's like to be persecuted for what you believe in. I never let it shake my beliefs.           |
| Forgiveness    | Someone once did me great harm. It was only much later that I learned to forgive them.                     |
| Gratitude      | Someone took me in when I had no one else to turn to. I'll always be grateful.                             |
| Hope           | I lost someone close to me to addiction and vice. I still hope that they'll get better someday.            |
| Humility       | I've seen what happens when people think they have all the answers. It never turns out well.               |
| Judgment       | I've seen people cause great harm in the name of faith. They laughed when I called it a sin.               |
| Loss           | One of my loved ones was stolen away from me. I'm still searching for them.                                |
| Loyalty        | Someone close to me fell onto a dark path. I'd do anything to redeem them.                                 |
| Nostalgia      | One of my parents loved to create things. Their work always brought me joy.                                |
| Oppression     | A cruel lord once ruled my community. I'll never forgive the harms he caused to my people.                 |
| Regret         | I once knew someone with grand, ambitious plans. I wish they'd heeded my advice.                           |
| Responsibility | I watched someone allow their family to come to ruin. I'll never do the same.                              |
| Romance        | Love never dies. It might flicker, but I'll never let it burn out.                                         |
| Secrecy        | I once promised someone I'd keep their secrets safe. I intend to do so—no matter the cost.                 |

Once a player has chosen their core motivation, use the relevant section below to aid that player in developing their character's history and goals.

### Knowledge — The Amber Shard 

![Amber Shard.png](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/7db64b11c71d88572ddc6cd06b888976/images/Amber%20Shard.png)  
A player seeking **knowledge** begins the campaign with the _amber shard_, a small chunk of amber resin mounted on a chain-link cord. The shard is inset with complex, three-dimensional arcane runes. When viewed under the _detect magic_ spell, it exudes a strong aura of abjuration magic.

Unbeknownst to the player, the _amber shard_ was formerly a part of a dark vestige's amber sarcophagus in the Amber Temple in Barovia. When it senses the presence of Death House, it glows with amber light and tugs its cord in the direction of the house.

The player who possesses the _amber shard_ should have strong, vivid reasons to want to unlock its secrets and the magic that it possesses.

**_Developments._** In [Arc A - Escape From Death House](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+I+-+Into+the+Mists/Arc+A+-+Escape+From+Death+House), the player recognizes Elisabeth Durst's _amber shard_ as similar in appearance to their own. In [Arc G - The Strazni Siblings](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+II+-+The+Shadowed+Town/Arc+G+-+The+Strazni+Siblings), the player recognizes Izek Strazni's _amber shard_ in a similar way. In [Arc R - Trials of the Mountain](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+IV+-+Secrets+of+the+Ancient/Arc+R+-+Trials+of+the+Mountain), Elder Burebis of Soldav can recognize the _amber shard_ as a shard of evil taken from the Amber Temple, and the player can recognize the _amber shards_ kept by the **shoosuva** and **bodaks** as resembling their own.

If the player character is reduced to 0 hit points in Barovia while in possession of their _amber shard_, it behaves as described in [Amber Shards](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Appendices/Amber+Shards) offering the player an opportunity to forge a pact with a vestige of the Amber Temple that fits the player character's personality, flaws, and temptations. Upon entering the Amber Temple, the player's _amber shard_ glows and tugs in the same way that it did upon sensing Death House, guiding the player toward a suitable amber sarcophagus.

### Redemption — The Angel's Feather 

![Angel's Feather.png](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/7db64b11c71d88572ddc6cd06b888976/images/Angel's%20Feather.png)  
A player seeking **redemption** begins the campaign with the _angel's feather_, a large, snow-white feather. When viewed beneath the light of the morning sun, the feather's barbs glimmer like gold.

Unbeknownst to the player, the _angel's feather_ formerly belonged to Ithuriel, a **deva** that serves the god Lathander, who is known to his followers as the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]]. Ithuriel is the true name of the Abbot, who dwells in the Abbey of Saint Markovia in Barovia. When it senses the presence of Death House, the feather is swept away by an unseen wind, its barbs glimmering with golden light, before eventually landing on the house's threshold.

The player who possesses the _angel's feather_ should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the feather will one day lead them to redemption for the sins that they have committed.

**_Developments._** When the players first arrive at the Abbey in [Arc I - The Walls of Krezk](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+II+-+The+Shadowed+Town/Arc+I+-+The+Walls+of+Krezk) or [Arc K - The Fallen Abbey](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+III+-+The+Broken+Land/Arc+K+-+The+Fallen+Abbey) the _angel's feather_ glimmers and is swept away in the same way that it did upon sensing Death House, guiding the player toward the Abbot. The Abbot recognizes the feather as his own, but dismisses its importance.

### Family — The Wanderer's Scarf 

![Wanderer's Scarf.png](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/7db64b11c71d88572ddc6cd06b888976/images/Wanderer's%20Scarf.png)  
A player seeking **family** begins the campaign with the _wanderer's scarf_, a multicolored scarf woven with complex patterns. The fabric is soft and warm, and is long enough to be worn around the neck or over one's head. When bright sunlight, moonlight, or starlight is allowed to pass through it, the patterns seem to shimmer and twist in eerie and beautiful ways.

Unbeknownst to the player, the _wanderer's scarf_ once belonged to a Vistana who left their caravan and settled down to marry the one they loved. The scarf was a parting gift from the caravan's leader—a reminder of the joys that the Vistana had experienced while traveling. When it senses the presence of Death House, the scarf is carried away by a warm, playful breeze, its patterns shifting and turning in the air, before eventually landing on the house's threshold.

The player who possesses the _wanderer's scarf_ should have received the scarf from a beloved family member, and should have strong, vivid reasons to long for a sense of family and belonging.

**_Developments._** When the players first encounter Ezmerelda in [Arc K - The Fallen Abbey](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+III+-+The+Broken+Land/Arc+K+-+The+Fallen+Abbey), the _wanderer's scarf_ shimmers and is carried away in the same way that it did upon sensing Death House, landing at Ezmerelda's feet. Ezmerelda recognizes the scarf and, upon confirming how the player came to inherit it, greets the player as family, calling them "cousin."

### Inheritance — The Dragon's Scale 

![Dragon's Scale.png](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/7db64b11c71d88572ddc6cd06b888976/images/Dragon's%20Scale.png)  
A player seeking **inheritance** begins the campaign with the _dragon's scale_, a large silver scale that always feels cold to the touch. A Good-aligned creature that touches the scale feels a fleeting sense of safety, protection, and comfort.

Unbeknownst to the player, the _dragon's scale_ formerly belonged to Argynvost, the **adult silver dragon** who founded [[the Order of the Silver Dragon]]. The order's headquarters, the mansion of Argynvostholt, can be found in Barovia. When it senses the presence of Death House, the scale burns with an icy cold, one end glowing with a bright, silver light in the direction of the house. While the scale glows in this way, a Good-aligned creature that touches it feels a deep sense of longing, loss, and hope.

The player who possesses the _dragon's scale_ should have received the scale from a family member, and should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the scale will one day unlock the secrets of their heritage.

**_Developments._** When the player first encounters Argynvost's shadow in the foyer of Argynvostholt in [Arc M - The Dragon's Manor](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+III+-+The+Broken+Land/Arc+M+-+The+Dragon's+Manor), the scale briefly burns cold in the same way that it did upon sensing Death House. Each time the player approaches a manifestation of Argynvost's spirit, the scale burns cold and glows with a bright, silver light in the direction of the manifestation.

If the player helps to retrieve Argynvost's skull and restore it to his crypt in [Arc Q - A Shining Beacon](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+III+-+The+Broken+Land/Arc+Q+-+A+Shining+Beacon), Argynvost's spirit greets the player warmly, naming them his heir to the legacy of the Order of the Silver Dragon before lighting the beacon of Argynvostholt.

### Wealth — The Electrum Coin 

![Electrum Coin.png](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/7db64b11c71d88572ddc6cd06b888976/images/Electrum%20Coin.png)  
A player seeking **wealth** begins the campaign with an old, chipped _electrum coin_ stamped with the profiled visage of a proud, yet cold-looking nobleman. When seen in a certain light, the nobleman's expression seems to change from a firm, aristocratic sneer to a feral, monstrous snarl.

Unbeknownst to the player, the visage stamped upon the _electrum coin_ is the face of [[Strahd von Zarovich]], the undead ruler of Barovia. The coin was minted long ago, but spirited away from [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s treasuries by a thief shortly before Barovia was lost to the mists. When it senses the presence of Death House, the coin lands on its edge, then begins rolling across the ground toward the house until it reaches the base of its steps.

The player who possesses the _electrum coin_ should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the coin first came from a wondrous vault of treasure—a conqueror's hoard—and that, one day, it will lead them to claim riches beyond imagining.

**_Developments._** Any Barovian immediately recognizes the visage stamped upon the coin as [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s. If the player shares the coin's story with one of the Vistani of Madam Eva's camp in [Arc C - Into the Valley](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+I+-+Into+the+Mists/Arc+C+-+Into+the+Valley), Sir Godfrey Gwilym in [Arc M - The Dragon's Manor](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+III+-+The+Broken+Land/Arc+M+-+The+Dragon's+Manor), or Kasimir Velikov in [Arc E - The Missing Vistana](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+II+-+The+Shadowed+Town/Arc+E+-+The+Missing+Vistana), they can learn of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s vast hoard of treasure, collected in his days as a conqueror and hidden away in Castle Ravenloft.

When the player first approaches [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s treasury, the coin lands on its edge and rolls as far as it can toward the treasury's entrance, in the same way that it did upon sensing Death House.

### Healing — The Wolf's Tooth 

![Wolf's Tooth.png](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/7db64b11c71d88572ddc6cd06b888976/images/Wolf's%20Tooth.png)  
A player seeking **healing** begins the campaign with a _wolf's tooth_ coated with clear resin and mounted on a leather cord. The tooth seems to lengthen and sharpen on nights of the full moon, and calms its wearer's dreams when worn at night.

Unbeknownst to the player, the tooth once belonged to a wolfir—a **werewolf** that served the fey goddess known as [[The Ladies of the Fanes|the Huntress]] before her gift of lycanthropy was twisted into a curse. [[The Ladies of the Fanes|The Huntress]]'s holy place, the Forest Fane, dwells amidst the woodlands of Barovia, silently waiting to be restored. When it senses the presence of Death House, the tooth lengthens, glowing with silver moonlight, and tugs its cord in the direction of the house.

The player who possesses the _wolf's tooth_ should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the tooth is the key to curing a particular wound, malady, or curse that ails them.

**_Developments._** If the player shows the _wolf's tooth_ to Kavan in [Arc J - The Stolen Gem](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+III+-+The+Broken+Land/Arc+J+-+The+Stolen+Gem) or to Elder Burebis in [Arc R - Trials of the Mountain](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+IV+-+Secrets+of+the+Ancient/Arc+R+-+Trials+of+the+Mountain), the tooth is recognized as an artifact and symbol of [[The Ladies of the Fanes|the Huntress]]. When the player first approaches the circle of stones at the Forest Fane in [Arc T - The Three Fanes](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+IV+-+Secrets+of+the+Ancient/Arc+T+-+The+Three+Fanes), the tooth lengthens and glows with moonlight as it did upon sensing Death House.

### Duty — The Raven's Feather 

![Raven's Feather.png](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/7db64b11c71d88572ddc6cd06b888976/images/Raven's%20Feather.png)  
A player seeking **duty** begins the campaign with a _raven's feather_, a small, black feather with soft, downy barbs. When held aloft before a storm, the feather seems to gently tremble, exuding the scent of cold rain and damp earth.

Unbeknownst to the player, the feather once belonged to the **roc** of Mount Ghakis, a servant of the fey goddess known as [[The Ladies of the Fanes|the Seeker]], whose Mountain Fane rests in the shadow of Mount Ghakis in Barovia. The roc once enjoyed disguising itself as a common raven, and shed this feather on one such occasion. When it senses the presence of Death House, the feather is swept away by an unseen and violent wind, the scent of rain and ozone filling the air, before eventually landing on the house's threshold.

The player who possesses the _raven's feather_ should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the feather will always guide them to those who need aid, protection, and comfort.

**_Developments._** If the player shows the _raven's feather_ to Madam Eva in [Arc C - Into the Valley](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+I+-+Into+the+Mists/Arc+C+-+Into+the+Valley), she inspects it reverently and returns it to the player, claiming mysteriously that she once knew the bird that shed it. If the player shows the feather to Urwin Martikov, Danika Dorakova, [[Muriel Vinshaw]], or any other member of the Keepers of the Feather, that member grows warmer and friendlier toward that player.

When the player first enters the circle of standing stones at the Mountain Fane in [Arc T - The Three Fanes](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+IV+-+Secrets+of+the+Ancient/Arc+T+-+The+Three+Fanes), the feather trembles and the air around it briefly grows thick with the scent of rain and ozone as it did upon sensing Death House. If the player shows the feather to the Roc of Mount Ghakis after consecrating the Mountain Fane in the same arc, the roc places the tip of its beak against the player's forehead as a sign of gratitude and approval before departing.

### Power — The Crumpled Page 

![Crumpled Page.png](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/7db64b11c71d88572ddc6cd06b888976/images/Crumpled%20Page.png)  
A player seeking **power** begins the campaign with the _crumpled page_, an old, yellowed page that was torn from its book long ago. The page is written in strange and cryptic arcane runes; those few runes that can be decoded speak of a path that leads to immortality and untold power.

Unbeknownst to the player, the page was taken from the library of Exethanter, a **lich** who dwells in the deepest sanctum of the Amber Temple in Barovia. When it senses the presence of Death House, the ink on the page glows with amber light, the runes reshaping themselves into a map that leads to the house.

The player who possesses the _crumpled page_ should have strong, vivid reasons to want to find and claim the power that the page promises.

**_Developments._** When the player first approaches Exethanter's library in [Arc S - A Sword of Sunlight](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+IV+-+Secrets+of+the+Ancient/Arc+S+-+A+Sword+of+Sunlight), the ink glows with amber light as it did upon sensing Death House, and the runes reshape themselves into a map of Exethanter's chambers and nearby access points. If the player shows the page to Exethanter after restoring his memories in the same arc, Exethanter grows warmer and friendlier toward that player.

### Ambition — The Tattered Banner 

![Tattered Banner.png](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/7db64b11c71d88572ddc6cd06b888976/images/Tattered%20Banner.png)  
A player seeking **ambition** begins the campaign with the _tattered banner_, an old, ragged red banner bearing the heraldry of a raven in front of a shield. The raven's wings are spread wide, and the shield has the image of a castle's keep engraved into its top. Sometimes, when a Lawful-aligned creature holds the banner, a crimson light seems to glimmer from the peak of the castle's keep, and the sound of soldiers marching can be distantly heard.

Unbeknownst to the player, the banner was once flown by the warlord [[Strahd von Zarovich]] in the days before he became a vampire and was trapped within the mists of Barovia. When it senses the presence of Death House, the distant sound of war-drums fills its holder's ears and the banner blows in an unseen wind, pulling toward the house's direction.

The player who possesses the _tattered banner_ should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the banner was once the sigil of a mighty conqueror—and that, by following in that conqueror's steps, they will one day achieve greatness, glory, and the right to rule.

**_Developments._** When the player first experiences the haunted battlefield north of Berez in [Arc I - The Walls of Krezk](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+II+-+The+Shadowed+Town/Arc+I+-+The+Walls+of+Krezk), the banner flaps in the wind, which echoes with the sound of war-drums.

If the player shows the banner to the revenant at Tser Falls in [Arc C - Into the Valley](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+I+-+Into+the+Mists/Arc+C+-+Into+the+Valley), Sir Godfrey Gwilym or Sir Vladimir Horngaard in [Arc M - The Dragon's Manor](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+III+-+The+Broken+Land/Arc+M+-+The+Dragon's+Manor), or Kasimir Velikov in either [Arc E - The Missing Vistana](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+II+-+The+Shadowed+Town/Arc+E+-+The+Missing+Vistana) or [Arc S - A Sword of Sunlight](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+IV+-+Secrets+of+the+Ancient/Arc+S+-+A+Sword+of+Sunlight), its appearance is met with revulsion and bitter disgust.

If the player shows the banner to [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], he regards it with fond thoughtfulness, but declines to elaborate on its significance. If the player shows the banner to [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten]] in **Arc M: Strahd's Enemy** or any Vistani, they immediately recognize it as the heraldry of Castle Ravenloft.

### Faith — The Sunrise Medallion 

![Sunrise Medallion.png](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/7db64b11c71d88572ddc6cd06b888976/images/Sunrise%20Medallion.png)  
A player seeking **faith** begins the campaign with the _sunrise medallion_, a bronze disc engraved with the image of a rising sun. The disc glitters like gold when exposed to the light of the sunrise, and a Good-aligned creature that touches it feels a fleeting sense of reverence, righteousness, and peace.

Unbeknownst to the player, the medallion once belonged to Sergei von Zarovich, the brother of [[Strahd von Zarovich]] and an acolyte of the [[Church of the Morninglord]] who was once expected to become its Most High Priest. When it senses the presence of Death House, the medallion shines with a warm, golden glow, the rays of sunlight emanating from the engraved sun pointing in the direction of the house.

The player who possesses the _sunrise medallion_ should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that it will strengthen or guide them in faith, and that certain signs of the divine will lead them to those in need of salvation and deliverance.

**_Developments._** When the player first approaches St. Andral's Church in [Arc D - St. Andral's Feast](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+II+-+The+Shadowed+Town/Arc+D+-+St.+Andral's+Feast), the _sunrise medallion_ glows and shines in the direction of the church's doors. If the player shows the _sunrise medallion_ to [[Father Donavich]] or Lucian, they recognize it as a symbol of the [[Church of the Morninglord]] and grow warmer and friendlier toward that player.

### Harmony — The Stone Crest 

![Stone Crest.png](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/7db64b11c71d88572ddc6cd06b888976/images/Stone%20Crest.png)  
A player seeking **harmony** begins the campaign with the _stone crest_, a flat, round stone engraved with the image of a three-pointed star. On the nights of the new moon, the star seems to glimmer with emerald light.

Unbeknownst to the player, the crest once belonged to a spiritual leader among the First Folk, the people who first settled the land of Barovia long ago, and who have now divided into the Forest Folk (who are loyal to [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]) and the Mountain Folk (who are not). The engravings upon it depict the symbols of [[The Ladies of the Fanes|the Seeker]], [[The Ladies of the Fanes|the Weaver]], and [[The Ladies of the Fanes|the Huntress]]—the three fey goddesses that the First Folk once called the _Rozana_, or Ladies Three. When it senses the presence of Death House, the crest emits a low hum and releases a scent of pine needles and earthy soil, which both grow stronger as the player approaches the house.

The player who possesses the _stone crest_ should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that the symbols upon it represent a primal or divine power of harmony and nature, and that the crest can aid them in restoring the sanctity of wild places.

**_Developments._** When the player first approaches the exterior of Soldav in [Arc R - Trials of the Mountain](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+IV+-+Secrets+of+the+Ancient/Arc+R+-+Trials+of+the+Mountain), the _stone crest_ hums and releases a scent of pine needles and earth soil as it did upon sensing Death House, both of which grow stronger as the player approaches the Shrine of the Rozana in Soldav.

If the player shows the _stone crest_ to Kavan in [Arc J - The Stolen Gem](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+III+-+The+Broken+Land/Arc+J+-+The+Stolen+Gem) or to Elder Burebis in [Arc R - Trials of the Mountain](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+IV+-+Secrets+of+the+Ancient/Arc+R+-+Trials+of+the+Mountain), the crest is recognized as an artifact and symbol of [[the Ladies of the Fanes]].

### Justice — The Broken Blade 

![Broken Blade.png](https://publish-01.obsidian.md/access/7db64b11c71d88572ddc6cd06b888976/images/Broken%20Blade.png)  
A player seeking **justice** begins the campaign with the _broken blade_, the shattered tip of an elven longsword. The blade is engraved with the sigil of a lion rampant, which seems to roar when the light of dusk touches it.

Unbeknownst to the player, the blade once belonged to Erevan, a dusk elf prince. Erevan, a master bladesinger, practiced the style of the lion, which he also used as his personal sigil. However, Erevan refused to pay tribute to King Barov von Zarovich, a powerful warlord and the father of [[Strahd von Zarovich]].

[[Rahadin]], a dusk elf who had spurned Erevan's rule, helped King Barov conquer the dusk elf kingdom. [[Rahadin]] then broke Erevan's blade and personally executed Erevan and his family as punishment for his defiance. When it senses the presence of Death House, the blade emits a high-pitched hum and begins to tremble violently, spinning like a compass needle in the direction of the house.

The player who possesses the _broken blade_ should have strong, vivid reasons to believe that their ancestors were refugees, driven forth from their ancestral lands and persecuted, and that the blade will one day deliver justice to the traitor who destroyed them.

**_Developments._** If the player shows the _broken blade_ to Kasimir Velikov in [Arc E - The Missing Vistana](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+II+-+The+Shadowed+Town/Arc+E+-+The+Missing+Vistana), he mournfully recalls its history and asks the player how they came to possess it. If the player informs Kasimir of how they came to inherit it, Kasimir greets them as family, wondering aloud if more of the dusk elves may have escaped [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s slaughter outside of Barovia.

If the _broken blade_ is ever in close proximity to [[Rahadin]], [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s chamberlain, it emits a high-pitched hum and trembles violently, spinning like a compass needle in his direction just as it did upon sensing Death House. If the player shows the _broken blade_ to [[Rahadin]], he at first claims to have no memory of it, noting dispassionately the thousands that he has slaughtered. However, in combat, [[Rahadin]] eventually comes to remember the blade's origins, dismissing it as "the shattered toy of a weak and worthless man."

# Session Zero
## Setting Expectations
---
Before beginning the campaign, you should establish the following expectations with your players:

- **_Tone_**. This will be a heroic fantasy adventure in a dark fantasy/gothic horror setting. Your character should be a hero, or have the potential to swiftly become a hero when faced with a life-or-death situation. Be prepared to cooperate and collaborate with the other players in order to succeed.
- **_Theme_**. While this campaign will not explore or focus upon your character's personal backstory, you should allow the campaign's characters and setting to inspire your character to confront their own regrets, traumas, flaws, and fears.
- **_Engagement_**. This campaign takes place in a setting with a deep history, including complex relationships between several dozen non-player characters. You should expect to take notes and take a sincere interest in the lore of this world.
- **_Tactics & Difficulty._**. This campaign has been balanced to present a challenging, but fair gameplay experience. However, to succeed, you will often need to recruit additional allies while avoiding alienating potential enemies. Consider the consequences of your actions carefully, and avoid taking actions without careful consideration.
- **_Roleplay_**. This campaign is primarily driven by the stories of its non-player characters, and their relationships to the party. Be prepared to form meaningful relationships with the characters you encounter, and allow yourself to emotionally invest in those characters' success.
- **_Rewards_**. Treasure, magic items, and other material rewards will be far more scarce than in an ordinary fantasy campaign. Instead, most rewards will take the form of allies, information, and new story hooks, with experience points awarded for narrative milestones you achieve as you proceed through the campaign.
- **_Narrative_**. The campaign begins with a linear structure, but soon evolves into a more expansive sandbox. Be prepared to balance and prioritize multiple quests, including many with clear deadlines.
## Triggers & Accommodations
---
Our aim is to create a memorable and enjoyable gothic horror experience for everyone involved. To that end, it's essential to address any potentially uncomfortable or controversial topics before beginning your _Curse of Strahd_ adventure. During Session Zero, we encourage open and honest communication with your players about their personal boundaries and any elements of the campaign that may require modification or removal.

A list of potentially uncomfortable topics you might want to discuss with your players before beginning the campaign includes:

- Child abuse and death (e.g., the Durst children)
- Torture and mutilation (e.g., Kasimir's severed ears)
- Mind control (e.g., Strahd's **_charm_** ability)
- (Implied) incest (e.g., the Belviews)
- Stalking and (symbolic) sexual assault (e.g., Strahd's obsession with Ireena)
- Suicide (e.g., Tatyana's death)
- Drug addiction (e.g., the dream pastries)
- Body horror (e.g., the vestiges' dark gifts)
- Racism (e.g., Barovian views of the Vistani)
## Campaign Contract
---
To ensure all players are on the same page when beginning the campaign, consider having each player review and/or sign the following "campaign contract" during Session Zero:

> [!cutscene] Campaign Contract
> I, **____________________________________**, understand and agree to the following expectations:
> 
> - I will make and play a character who is—while potentially flawed—either (a) actively heroic; or (b) a sociable, cooperative character who inevitably and actively begins growing towards heroism within the first five sessions.
> - I will allow my character to feel true, powerless fear when faced with an overwhelming threat, and allow that fear to impact my character's actions, growth, and development.
> - I will make every reasonable effort to build meaningful short- and long-term relationships with NPCs, and allow myself to become emotionally invested in their lives and goals.
> - This campaign requires alliances and cooperation with NPCs and other players, rather than paranoia or antisocial behavior.
> - The DM will not try to trick me, and will give me a fair chance to avoid bad situations through clear foreshadowing. However, NPCs will withhold nonessential lore and character information unless specifically requested.
> - This campaign will largely focus on social encounters, investigations, and exploration, and combat may occur as infrequently as once every two or three sessions.
> - Treasure, magic items, and expensive spell components will be rare and infrequently obtained, with most rewards taking the form of relationships and alliances with friendly NPCs.
> - This campaign will take place in a "fish-out-of-water" setting, and elements from my character's backstory will not directly appear or be referenced in the campaign unless the DM specifies otherwise ahead of time.
> - It is my sole responsibility to collaborate with the DM and other players to provide my character with an internal emotional character arc if desired.
> - Some powerful enemies will be impossible to defeat through combat, and that we will need to either gain levels, allies, or resources in order to do so.
> - Creature alignments and morality will not always be determined by their species or type. Some monsters can be neutral, or even friendly, while some humanoids can be monstrously irredeemable.
> - The DM has balanced any expected combat encounters to make a TPK unlikely unless we make poor decisions; should a TPK occur, the party **may** have an opportunity to "fail forward" and continue the campaign, albeit with severe consequences; although this is not guaranteed in every situation.
> - This campaign has altered the statistics for many official D&D 5e monsters, and has introduced additional mechanics or altered statistics for other enemies to create a balanced, high-tension combat experience that may differ from the _Monster Manual_ and other official supplements.
> - I will not seek out any information, artwork, videos, or other media relevant to Curse of Strahd, or any characters, locations, or lore within the campaign.

> [!warning]- Breaking the Fourth Wall
> Sometimes, a player will act in a way that seems to break the [[#Campaign Contract]]. 
> 
> For example, a frustrated, trigger-happy, or mistrustful player might plot to attack and kill an NPC that can be allied or befriended.
> 
> When this happens, don't hesitate to pause the game, remind the player of the relevant provision of the campaign contract, and ensure everyone is on the same page before resuming play.
