> [!warning]- The Road from Tser Pool
> The module’s map of Barovia depicts a dotted line that appears to connect the [[#C4. Tser Pool]] Encampment to [[#C7b. Tser Falls]]. Despite its appearance, [[#C7b. Tser Falls]] makes clear that this is not a shortcut. Instead, this dotted line is a footpath that leads to the base of [[#C7b. Tser Falls]], one thousand feet below the bridge overhead. At no point does it actually reconnect to the main road.
> 
> To travel from the [[#C4. Tser Pool]] Encampment to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], the players will instead need to travel south, back toward the [[#C2. River Ivlis Crossroads]], then take the Old Svalich Road westward.

> [!info]- No Random Encounters
> This guide incorporates the material in the original _Curse of Strahd_ module only by reference. As such, whenever the players are traveling, you should disregard the [[Random Encounters]] section except where a particular encounter is referenced and incorporated directly.
# C1. The Svalich Woods (C)

The journey from [[the village of Barovia]] to the River Ivlis Crossroads is three miles long and takes one hour.
## C1a. The Barovian Scouts
---
This takes place as the players leave [[The Village of Barovia]], and references the "Barovian Scout" random encounter (3.)

> [!cutscene] As the players travel, read:
> You set off from the silent village of Barovia, the fog creeping around your feet as you pass onto the Old Svalich Road. A sea of tall, pale-green grasses stretches out before you on either side of the road, all the way up to the edge of the Ivlis River. The sky above is a dull grey, the clouds heavy with the promise of rain.
> 
> It's not long before you can see the old arched stone bridge in the distance that spans the clear blue river ahead. Crossing it, you find yourselves on a muddy road that winds its way through the trees. The air is thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, and the trees press in close, casting deep shadows that carve dark gouges across the road.

If any players have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher, they hear a rustling noise and see a silhouette crouching in the misty underbrush.
Otherwise, the players simply hear a voice call out, muffled and diffuse in the fog:
“Who goes there? Name yourselves.”

The voice belongs to a gruff female Barovian **scout** named [[Kereza]], who is joined by a second, soft-spoken male **scout** named [[Korga]], whom the players previously encountered in [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia]].
After confirming that the players are not transporting [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] against her will, the scouts warn the players that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s spies are numerous throughout the [[#C1. The Svalich Woods]], including wolves, bats, and—at times—the very trees themselves. (If asked about the trees, the scouts can describe seeing animate vines, saplings, and bramble-patches that wander through the woods with hostile intent.)

If [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is with the players, she can aid the players in reassuring the scouts, who recognize her and greet her with quiet respect. The scouts are surprised to see [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] venturing forth from [[The Village of Barovia|the village]], but agree that [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] is likely a safer place than [[The Village of Barovia]]—assuming, of course, that she can make it there safely. ([[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] stubbornly insists, however, that her journey is a diplomatic and humanitarian one, and that the players are her escorts and bodyguards.)

The scouts are searching for the [[Lansten family]]: two parents and three young children—a girl and two boys—who went missing during the zombie attack on the village and haven’t been seen since. After asking whether the players have seen their quarries on their journey, the scouts warn them not to stray from the road, noting that dead and dark things lurk beneath the treetops. [[Kereza]] and [[Korga]] then respectfully depart.

Shortly after the players resume their trek down the Old Svalich Road, a light drizzle begins to fall, stirring a fine mist that drifts through the underbrush.
## C1b. Van Richten's Cache
---
> [!cutscene] As the players continue down the road, read:
> You travel further into the woods, the muddy road guiding you deeper and further away from civilization. As the road bends, the river brushes up against you once more. Here, the river is wider, its waters dark and calm. You can see the reflection of the trees and fog in its surface. The sound of the quiet, trickling water is met only by the rustling of leaves and the drizzle of soft rain. No birdsong breaks the silence that hangs over the woods.

While traversing this section of the Old Svalich Road, the players are stalked by one of [[#^StrahdsSpies|Strahd's Spies]]: a **wolf.**

> [!info]- Strahd's Spies
> As the undisputed master of Barovia, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] has many spies, from swarms of bats to wandering travellers, who report to him at dawn and dusk each day. These agents constantly patrol the land of Barovia and report everything they see to him.
> 
> Every day and night that the characters remain in Barovia, one or more of the vampire's spies check on them and attempt to return to [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] with a report. When a spy appears, characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score equal to or greater than the spy's Dexterity (Stealth) check notice it. A spy does not constitute an encounter if the characters are unaware of its presence. If they do notice it, the spy's goal is usually escape, not combat. A secondary goal for a spy might be to acquire some physical object—a possession, an article of clothing, or even some part of a character's body such as a lock of hair—that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] can use to improve the efficacy of his [scrying](https://2014.5e.tools/spells.html#scrying_phb) spell. If one of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s spies is confronted by the party, the spy attempts to grab some accessible item from a character before fleeing. If [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] acquires such an item, he uses his [scrying](https://2014.5e.tools/spells.html#scrying_phb) spell to learn as much as he can about the party before planning his next attack, and to verify what his spies have already told him.
> ^StrahdsSpies

If the players received the location of [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]]’s hidden weapons cache from [[Doru]] in [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia#B5i. The Barovian Church (E5)|Barovia’s church]], they can enter the woods to the south to find it.

> [!cutscene] If they do, read:
> You step from the road and into the woods, crossing the treeline as your feet squelch into mud and loamy soil. Wisps of fog curl across the earth around you, gnarled trees reaching their arms overhead as gray light filters through the canopy. You walk for three hundred paces, stepping softly through the mulch and mist until you arrive at a clearing, the woods parting to make room for a tall, ancient oak whose knotted black trunk rises far above its peers.
> 
> You soon realize, however, that you’re not alone. Five figures shamble or stand aimlessly within the clearing, their clothes muddied and torn and their flesh just beginning to turn pallid and gray.

The five figures are **zombies**. They also match the descriptions of the [[Lansten family]] provided by the scouts—two parents, a young girl, and two young boys.

The players can attempt to lure the zombies away from the clearing; given the zombies’ low intelligence, doing so should be reasonably easy. Alternatively, the players can attempt to ambush and attack the zombies to destroy them altogether.

> [!info]- Undead Fortitude
> Revise each **zombie** **_undead fortitude_** feature to read as follows:
> 
>- **_Undead Fortitude (1/day)._** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead. The zombie can’t use this ability if the damage is radiant or from a critical hit, if the damage taken is 15 or more, or if it had only 1 hit point remaining.

If the players reach the oak tree, they can find [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]]’s weapons cache where [[Doru]] told them: in a hollow nestled beneath the tree’s roots. The cache itself is a small, unlocked wooden chest containing 20 silvered crossbow bolts, a light crossbow, two _healer’s kits_, two vials of _holy water_, and one _potion of healing._

> [!item]- Silvered Crossbow Bolts (20)
> Ammunition (crossbow bolt)
> 0.3 lb.

> [!item]- Light Crossbow
>Weapon
>Simple weapon, ranged weapon
>
25 gp, 5 lb.
1d8 piercing
>Ammunition (80/320 ft.), loading, two‑handed
>---
**Range.** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.
>
>**Ammunition.** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.
>	If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon. A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.
>
>**Loading.** Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.

> [!item]- Healer's Kit
> Adventuring gear
> 5 gp, 3 lb.
> 
> ---
>This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.

> [!item]- Holy Water (flask)
> Adventuring gear
> 25 gp, 1 lb.
> 
> ---
> As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.
> 
> A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.

> [!item]- Potion of Healing
> Potion, common
> 50 gp, 1/2 lb.
> 
> ---
> You regain 2d4+2 hit points when you drink this potion. The potion's red liquid glimmers when agitated.

# C2. River Ivlis Crossroads (F)

As the players approach this area, the drizzling rain stops.

> [!cutscene] When it does, read:
> Soon, the river bends once more out of sight and the dark woods surround the road once again. Finally, though, the trees pull away, revealing a tall cliff at the base of a foggy mountain slope. The air is cold and damp here, and soft wisps of fog swirl around the base of the cliff.

The players have arrived at the River Ivlis Crossroads. Do not check for a random encounter when the players arrive.

> [!cutscene] When they do, read:
> An old wooden gallows creaks in a chill wind that blows down from the high ground to the west. A frayed length of rope dances from its beam.
> The well-worn road splits here, and a signpost opposite the gallows points off in three directions: Barovia Village to the east, Tser Pool to the northwest, and Ravenloft/[[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] to the southwest.
> The northwest fork slants down and disappears into the trees, while the southwest fork clings to an upward slope. Across from the gallows, a low wall, crumbling in places, partially encloses a small plot of graves shrouded in fog.

The northwest fork leads down to the river and [[#C4. Tser Pool]]. The road southwest leads to [[#C7b. Tser Falls]]. The east road leads to an arching stone bridge and continues on to the [[The Village of Barovia|village of Barovia]].

The gallows stand atop a rotting platform 5 feet high, with wooden stairs leading up to it.

Eleven graves are here with blank gravestones. The forgotten people buried here were hanged from the gallows. Characters who dig up the graves find rotted coffins containing mouldy bones.

The first time the players move to depart for Tser Pool, instead of seeing **The Hanged One**, they can hear the sound of a horse-drawn carriage or wagon approaching through the fog. Almost as soon as the sound appears, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s black carriage, as described in Black Carriage (p. 37) and Carriage House (p. 54), comes into view.

> [!cutscene] When it does, read:
> From the path ahead of you, a sound emerges from the quiet beyond the mists. You recognise it immediately as the sound of a horse-drawn carriage or wagon approaching you through the fog. Almost as soon as the sound appears, you see it.
> A large black carriage drawn by two black horses moving along the road towards you. The Carriage is fitted with glass windows that conceal its inhabitants, and brass lanterns that swing unlit at its sides.
> 
> Sat within the coach box at its front, you see the driver. A handsome young man with a stoic expression. His attire, while elegant, is worn and faded. 
## C2a. Strahd's Arrival
---
The players can see a driver sitting in the coach box: the **vampire spawn** [[Escher]]. If present, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] gasps at the sight of him, whispering that she thought that he was dead.

> [!example]- What if the Players Flee?
> The players should have little time to attempt to conceal themselves before [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s carriage comes into view. However, if the players attempt to flee the carriage into the woods, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s **dire wolves**—one for each player plus [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]—emerge from the fog behind them and snarl, obstructing the players' escape.

The carriage then comes to a stop.

> [!cutscene] Read the following, modifying the text as necessary if [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] isn’t present, and pausing briefly after each paragraph to allow the players a short opportunity to act or react:
> The driver releases the reins, steps down from the coach box, and moves to open the side door of the carriage, bowing deeply. A moment passes—and then a man steps out from the carriage.
> 
> He is tall, gaunt, and dressed in finery befitting a man of aristocratic, even royal stature. A black cloak is pulled neatly around his shoulders, tied at the neck by a blood-red brooch. A longsword rests ensheathed at his hip, its polished hilt gleaming beneath the dim light. His scarlet tunic is worked with intricate designs, and his hair is pulled back into a sharp and immaculate widow's peak.
> 
> His eyes are dark, and as he moves to adjust the ruby at his neck, you see that his fingernails form long, elegant claws. It's only then that you realize that his skin is pale—unnaturally so— and that his eyes glint with a deep, intelligent hunger.

Give the party a moment to react.

> [!cutscene] If Ireena is with the party, read:
> [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] rocks backward, as if slapped. She averts her eyes from the man's gaze, her entire body tightening.
> 
> "Don't look into his eyes," she chokes out.
> 
> The man's gaze rests briefly on Ireena, and he smiles—though no warmth reaches his eyes. 
> "Lady Kolyana," he says.
> "What a pleasant surprise." He then turns his gaze to you.

Whether [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is with the party or not, continue here.

> [!cutscene] Read:
> "Good day," he says. "I am Count Strahd von Zarovich—and it is a pleasure to finally meet the newcomers to my domain. My friends have told me so much about you." His eyes linger over each one of you in turn, regarding you like a cut of meat weighed at market, an intriguing but inanimate trinket—a prey animal spotted by a predator in the bush.

> [!tip]- Strahd's Foretelling
> At the time that he encounters the players, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] is returning from a visit to [[#C4b. Madam Eva’s tent]] at the [[#C4. Tser Pool]] Encampment. Finding the [[Forest Fane]]’s power difficult to control due to [[Baba Zelenna]]’s interference during his slumber, he sought [[Madam Eva]]’s counsel in his preparations for the [[Grand Conjunction]]. He received the following fortune:
>
>- "The Darklord—the master of shadows, the beast in the labyrinth that tears at his chains."
>- "The Six of Stars, the Evoker—the power you covet, a force untamed by mortal hands, raw and wild with burning fury."
>- "The Artifact—the token you seek, the key to power. Divinity’s heart waits, but where?"
>- "The Innocent. I see a maid of raven hair and twilit eyes. She is one way to the token."
>- "But there is another—the Broken One. The path of sacrifice opens another door. The wall that whispers awaits your tribute."
>- "The threads of fate yet spin. The Seven of Swords, the Hooded One, is next. Strangers walk the land—their presence a riddle, their intentions a maze. They dwell in the dusk, their role yet unclear."
>- "But the One of Stars, the Transmuter, is last. Change comes on newcomers’ wings, the dusk of an era upon us. As one age ends, another is born."
>
>Much of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s foretelling was overheard by [[Muriel Vinshaw]], an eavesdropping **wereraven**, until [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] detected her presence and drove her away. Both [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]] and [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] were unaware that [[Madam Eva]] knew of [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]]’s presence all along. As the hidden avatar of the [[Seeker]], [[Madam Eva|Eva]] bears a special bond with [[Keepers of the Feather|Barovia’s wereravens]], and deliberately continued her foretelling to allow [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]] to hear it.
>
>[[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]] heard the first five cards that [[Madam Eva]] read, but doesn’t know the last two. More information about [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]] and her escape from [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s minions can be found in [[#C3. The Strix]].

See [[Strahd von Zarovich#How to Enjoy Roleplaying Strahd|here]] for info related to [[Strahd von Zarovich#Roleplaying Strahd|Roleplaying Strahd]].

> [!example]- The players misbehave 
> If a player acts rudely toward [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], he sighs and replies, "Disrespect is unbecoming, especially in the face of the Lord of the land you are but a guest in. But you are foreign, and untaught, and confused. I'll give you a warning, this time. But I fear my mercy will not last forever."
> 
> The first time a player disrespects [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] after receiving his warning, he smiles, holds up a single finger, and says, "One." [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s dire wolves, if they have not already emerged, step forth from the shadows and fix their gazes on the rude player.
> 
> The second time that a player disrespects [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], he shakes his head, holds up two fingers, and says, "Two." [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s dire wolves step closer to the rude player and begin salivating.
> 
> The third time that a player disrespects [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], he frowns. Read the following:
> 
> ---
> 
> "You seem to be under the misunderstanding that you are special," [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] says. "You are not. You are an outsider to my lands, with nary an ounce of respect or common wit. It amuses me, from time to time, to take the measure of those who enter the valley from beyond the Mists."
> 
> His eyes narrow. "But you have taken your own measure, and I have found it wanting. You are not brave. You are not cunning. You invite death, and I have never been one to deny my subjects such a wish, no matter how foolish. This final chance, I shall grant you, to save your own life—for I see no value in it above that of the lowliest creature that crawls in the muck."
> 
> He holds up a third finger. "The next time you speak, my pets will kill you. Any who defend you will share the same fate."
> 
> ---
> 
> If the player violates [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s ultimatum, pause the game and address the player out-of-character. Note that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] has promised clear consequences, and that the player's actions will invoke those consequences. Make clear that the player's character will die; that the player will not have a chance to prevent it; that any characters who attempt to protect that player will also die; that any characters who die will not be resurrected; and that if the entire party dies, the campaign will immediately end.
> 
> If the players confirms their decision, resume the game. [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s dire wolves then attack that player. If any or all of the other players do not interfere, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] continues his conversation with them, undisturbed.

> [!example]- The players flee
> If, at any point during the encounter, the players move to flee, read:
> 
> ---
> 
> From behind [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], you hear a chorus of low, feral growls. Multiple pairs of eyes glint from the underbrush—each one the height of a man's shoulder.
> 
> Slowly, from the shadows, slinks a pack of massive wolves, each one as tall as a horse and twice as muscled, measuring nine feet in length from head to haunches. Their fur is a thick, mottled grey, and saliva drips from their yellowed, sharpened teeth.
> 
> They take up positions behind and around Strahd, flanking him like a noble's honour guard.
> 
> "You must forgive my pets," [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] says. "They can be . . . **overenthusiastic** at the sight of new friends."
> 
> ---
> 
> The wolves are **dire wolves**, as described in Dire Wolves (p. 30). (The number of dire wolves in the pack is equal to the number of players in the party.)
> 
> If the players appear to need further persuading, the dire wolves step forward, growling with their hackles raised. If the players proceed to flee, the wolves attack.

> [!example]- The players challenge
> If, at any point during the encounter, a player challenges Strahd or insists that he must be defeated, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] smiles, admits he's "never been one to decline a challenge," and invites the player to defeat him—right here, right now—if they can. He promises to make no effort to stop them for the first thirty seconds of their assault.
> 
> If the player declines, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] dismisses them as a coward, noting with disappointment, "A pity. I had hoped for better." If the player accepts, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] allows them to attack him for five full rounds. During this time, each attack the player makes against [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] automatically hits, and [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] automatically fails all Strength and Dexterity saving throws.
> 
> When the five rounds have elapsed, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] says, "Impressive determination—if ultimately futile." He adds, "Now, let us see how you fare when the true game begins."
> 
> Assuming his Mage form, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] casts **_telekinetic grasp_** each round to suspend the player in the air above him, and casts **_blindness/deafness_** as a reaction whenever the player makes a melee attack against him. The first time the player fails their saving throw against **_telekinetic grasp_**, he says, "Escape if you can." He then adds, in a lower tone: "But should you find yourself lacking, a simple plea for mercy will release you from your plight."
> 
> The first time the player succeeds their saving throw against **_telekinetic grasp_**, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] applauds their tenacity, then asks whether they shall choose to continue to fight. (If they do, he continues to fight using his full Mage statblock.)
> 
> If the player asks to be freed from [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s **_telekinetic grasp_**, he does so without delay. "Wisdom lies in recognizing one's limitations," he notes. "Remember this moment—for the next time, I may not be as generous."
> 
> If the player is knocked unconscious by [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s **_telekinetic grasp_**, he crouches beside them, whispering: "You fought bravely, but even the greatest warrior cannot outlast the inevitable. Rest now, comforted by the knowledge that you have entertained me." He then turns to the remainder of the party and invites them to care for their wounded companion.
## C2b. The Conversation Begins
---
If undiverted, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] greets each of the player characters individually—by name, if his spies have had a chance to learn them and report back to him. While doing so, he makes a personal comment regarding each character’s species, class (if apparent from their equipment or dress), and/or personality (if reported by his spies). If possible, he frames each comment in the form of a compliment, sympathetic remark, or (sparingly) exceptionally veiled threat.

> [!example]- Strahd's Current Observations
> Observations made by [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] on the party can be found [[Strahd's Observations|here]].

If [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is present, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] then asks if “[[Ireena Kolyana|Lady Kolyana]]” has properly introduced them to his domain, and apologizes for any “folktales” his subjects may have shared about him.

(He does not, however, deny his attack on [[the village of Barovia]], noting only that the people of the village defied him in an act of utmost treason. "I am sure that you can agree that my response was a measured one," he says. "After all, no lord could tolerate a settlement that fostered such sedition. The good people of Barovia needed to be taught a lesson. Their discipline was a kindness that few others would entertain.")

As the conversation progresses, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] notes that he's heard "such wonderful things" of the players' exploits at "a certain old house at the edge of my domain." [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] then makes brief reference to the players' actions in [[Arc A - Escape from Death House|Death House]], sardonically lauding their "fierce and fiery valor."

If the players ask about the nature of [[Arc A - Escape from Death House|Death House]], or its purpose in bringing them to Barovia, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] smiles coldly and says only, "The souls of the damned are tragically twisted things. Do not linger upon their madness."

If the players ask about [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s driver, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] introduces him as [[Escher]], "my coachman and cupbearer." [[Escher]] does not respond to the players’ questions or statements and simply stands demurely at [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s side.

> [!example]- Requesting Freedom
> If the players ask whether [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] has intentionally trapped them in Barovia, he truthfully denies doing so.
> If asked to release them, however, he declines to do so.
> 
> "Why should I release you," he says, with a wry smile, "when it amuses me to do otherwise?"
## C2c. Strahd's Questions
---
During the conversation, at moments when it seems natural to do so, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] poses the players the following questions (in no particular order):

- "Ismark Kolyanovich defied me by obstructing the justice I meted out unto his village. Why should I, as his lord, not punish him for his disloyalty?"
  
- "I have claimed Ireena Kolyana, and marked her as my own. Why should I not take her with me to Castle Ravenloft right now?"
  
- "You are trespassers in my lands, and the last outsider that entered Barovia fostered sedition and treachery. Why should I not dispatch you now, to prevent you from doing the same?" ([[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s question is referring to [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten]].)

If the players buried [[Walter Durst|Walter]]'s bones and put the spirits of [[Arc A - Escape from Death House|Death House]] to rest, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] poses an additional question:

- "Immediately prior to your entry to my lands, you caused great damage to a group of my servants—the occupants of a particular house on the borders of my domain. I had relied upon those servants to bring me specimens of interest, but your activities have left them indefinitely indisposed. Why should I not punish you for your crimes against them?"

[[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] frames each of these questions as a hypothetical. In asking them, his tone is inquisitive, curious, and at least somewhat amused. If the players despair at the prospect of answering these questions at all, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] notes, "I am not an unreasonable man. If there is some reason or rationale that I might have missed, then by all means do enlighten me."
## C2d. Strahd's Concessions
---
As the players attempt to answer his questions, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] delights in playing Devil's advocate, pushing back against their responses and probing at the holes in their reasoning. Ultimately, though, if the players' points are at least reasonably well-argued, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] is willing to accept them. (It should be fairly clear to the players, however, that he is merely humouring them by accepting their responses.)

The players can push [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] to make the following concessions:

- He agrees to overlook [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]'s transgressions, so long as [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] does not defy him or act counter to his will again.
- He agrees to allow [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to depart the [[#C2. River Ivlis Crossroads|River Ivlis Crossroads]] safely. ([[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] will not grant a longer grace period than that.)
- He agrees to refrain from judgment against the players unless they take action directly against his person.
- He agrees to forgive the players their transgressions against the cult of [[Arc A - Escape from Death House|Death House]].

The players might successfully exact these concessions using a variety of arguments, including (but not limited to) the following:

- The players have promised [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] that they will escort [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] and they must be allowed to fulfil their word.
- The players have taken no hostile action against [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] and should be granted a presumption of innocence.
- The players' actions in [[Arc A - Escape from Death House|Death House]] were conducted in self-defence, and therefore should be excused.

If the players appear to doubt [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s fidelity to his concessions, [[An Anthology of Strahd's Taunts|he promises]]: 
"Fear not, dear children. I am no liar. We both know deception is for the weak."

When the players have answered all of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s questions to his satisfaction, he bids them farewell and steps back into the black carriage.

As he does, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s **dire wolves**—including one for each player plus [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]—emerge from the woods, if they haven’t already, and move to flank the carriage. [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] notes that he and his “friends” shall see the players again—perhaps very soon. The carriage and the wolves then depart for [[Castle Ravenloft]].
## C2e. Departing the Crossroads
---
As the players move to depart the [[#C2. River Ivlis Crossroads]] after [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] has left, they encounter The Hanged One.

> [!cutscene] When they do, read:
> You hear a creaking noise behind you, coming from the gallows. Where there was nothing before now hangs a lifeless, grey body. The breeze turns the hanged figure slowly, so that it can fix its dead eyes upon you.

One character, the character who was the rudest to [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] or the least cooperative with his questions, sees themself hanging from the gallows.
The other characters see an unfamiliar [[Barovians|Barovian]]. The corpse looks and smells real, and it rapidly melts away into nothing if touched or moved.
# C3. The Strix

Halfway down the path from the [[#C2. River Ivlis Crossroads]] to [[#C4. Tser Pool]] Encampment, the players hear the sound of a distressed bird cawing from above. A raven with blue-tipped wings—recognizably the same raven that met them in [[the village of Barovia]]—then crashes into the road at the players’ feet, visibly wounded. This is, again, the **wereraven** [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]], in disguise with 1 hit point. Her wings and torso have been penetrated by several dozen silver barbs, leaving her unable to fly, regenerate, or transform until removed.

> [!Info]- Dying NPCs
> As noted in Monsters and Death (Player's Handbook, p. 198), allied non-player characters—such as [[Muriel Vinshaw]] and any other NPC fighting alongside the players—should fall unconscious upon being reduced to 0 hit points. When they do, they follow the same rules for death saving throws as player characters, described further in Death Saving Throws (Player's Handbook, p. 197).

The raven’s arrival is followed soon after by a terrible, grating shriek and the arrival of a **greater strix**: a large artificial “bird” crafted of wood, animal skins, burlap, and hundreds of black raven’s feathers.

The **greater strix** uses the statistics of a **manticore**, but is a Medium construct and has vulnerability to fire damage. Instead of actual tail spikes, the greater strix’s **_tail spikes_** attack releases a volley of dozens of tiny silver barbs from its wings.

> [!handout]- "Greater Strix" by Caleb Cleveland
> ![[Greater Strix by Caleb Cleveland.png]]
> ^GreaterStrixbyCalebCleveland

The greater strix is joined by two **swarms of lesser strix** (each using the statistics of a **swarm of ravens**, but with vulnerability to fire damage). Each lesser strix is an artificial “crow” slightly larger than a raven, crafted of burlap, straw, twigs, and sharp stone teeth.

> [!combat]- Fight against the Strix
> This combat encounter is a **bruising** encounter against a party of five 3rd-level players and a CR 1 ally ([[Ireena Kolyana]]), and will consume approximately 34% of their total maximum hit points.

Reduce the number of swarms of lesser strix to one and reduce the swarm's hit points to 16 and its **_bite_** attack to 5 (2d4) piercing damage or 2 (1d4) piercing damage if it has half its hit points remaining or fewer.

These abominations were built by the witch [[Baba Lysaga]] to hunt down wereravens. These particular strix—a gift from [[Baba Lysaga]] to [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] upon his awakening—have been ordered to hunt and kill [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]], who was spotted eavesdropping on the Tarokka reading that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] received from [[Madam Eva]] earlier that morning. It continues to pursue [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]], attacking the players instead if they attempt to harm it or otherwise shelter [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]] from its assault. It fights to the death.

> [!Warning]- Don't hurt Ireena
> [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s minions and those loyal to him, including the strix, don't attack [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]].

If rescued, [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]] remains with the players until she can discern their intent. A player can remove the silver barbs in her body and wings with a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check, reducing her to 0 hit points and causing her to fall unconscious on a failure. Once the barbs are removed, however, [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]]’s regeneration immediately returns, healing her wounds in a matter of seconds.

If she learns that the players plan to travel to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]] travels with them while maintaining her raven disguise, hoping to rely upon safety in numbers until she can report her findings to [[Urwin Martikov]] at the Blue Water Inn. Under no conditions does [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]] willingly reveal her true nature to the players at this time.

> [!info]- Muriel Incognito
> While traveling with the players, [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]] tries to keep a low profile while ingratiating herself with the group. While she is in raven form, the players can communicate with her only using the _speak with animals_ spell, though she denies all knowledge of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] or the strix's origins and pretends to be an ordinary, simple-minded raven concerned only with food and avoiding predators. If asked for her name, she excitedly introduces herself as "Blue," and grows increasingly stubborn if questioned.
>
>While accompanying the group, [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]] may use her **_mimicry_** feature to produce any of the following sounds to prompt or react to the players:
>
>- **Whistle.** To signal secrecy or caution.
>- **Snoring.** To signal boredom.
>- **Laughter.** To signal amusement.
>- **Jingling.** To indicate someone's arrival.
>- **Clicking (like a key turning).** To applaud a solution to a problem.
>- **Trumpet.** To celebrate a victory or achievement.
# C4. Tser Pool (G)

The journey from the [[#River Ivlis Crossroads]] to the [[#C4. Tser Pool]] Encampment is one-and-a-half miles long and takes thirty minutes.
## C4a. Arrival at Tser Pool
---

> [!cutscene] When the player approach Tser Pool, read:
> The road gradually disappears and is replaced by a twisted, muddy path through the trees. Deep ruts in the earth are evidence of the comings and goings of wagons.
> 
> The canopy of mist and branches suddenly gives way to black clouds boiling far above. There is a clearing here, next to a river that widens to form a small lake several hundred feet across. Five colorful round tents, each ten feet in diameter, are pitched outside a ring of four barrel-topped wagons. A much larger tent stands near the shore of the lake, its sagging form lit from within. Near this tent, eight unbridled horses drink from the river.
> 
> The mournful strains of an accordion clash with the singing of several brightly clad figures around bonfire. A footpath continues beyond this encampment, meandering north between the river and the forest's edge.

The eight [draft horses](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#draft%20horse_mm) drinking from the river are used to pull the [[Vistani]] wagons and aren't easily startled.

Twelve [[Vistani]] (male and female Vistani Bandits) are standing and sitting around the fire and telling stories. Three [[Vistani]] (male and female human Vistani Bandit Captains) are resting in three of the four wagons but leap quickly into action if an alarm is raised.

Only one of the [[Vistani]]—a Vistana woman named [[Eliza]]—serves as a spy for [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]].

As the players enter the camp, they are met by [[Stanimir]], an old [[Vistani|Vistana]] who informs them that the leader of their encampment, [[Madam Eva]], has been waiting for them and points them toward [[Madam Eva|Eva]]’s tent. [[Stanimir]], a jovial, colourful old man with a twinkle in his eye is largely as described in Mysterious Visitors (p. 19). However, he has the spell _major image_ prepared rather than _vampiric touch_.

[[Stanimir]] is happy to answer any questions that the players may have about the [[Vistani]] or about Barovia, as described in [[Vistani#Vistani Lore|Vistani Lore]]. The sole exceptions are the information about soulless [[Barovians]], which don't exist, and Old Bonegrinder, which [[Stanimir]] doesn't mention. In addition, [[Stanimir]] and the other [[Vistani]] don't know that a coven of **night hags** has recently taken up residence in the old windmill, which they know only as the Old Durst Mill. The [[Vistani]] also don't mention [[Vistani]] curses, which are the stuff of mere superstition, and describe [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s interest in Tatyana as "true desire," rather than "true love."

However, [[Stanimir]] will not discuss [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s business at [[#C4. Tser Pool (G)]]. Instead, he shares his belief that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] will not soon return, and reassures the players that anything discussed at their meeting with [[Madam Eva]] will not reach the vampire’s ears.

If the players ask whether [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] obtained a foretelling from [[Madam Eva]], [[Stanimir]] tells them that [[Madam Eva]] shares her gifts freely with all—but that each person’s future is different, and often difficult to discern.
## C4b. Madam Eva's Tent
---
This scene unfolds largely as described in [[Madam Eva]]’s Tent (p. 37). After greeting the players, [[Madam Eva]] names each player character personally, giving them one or more symbolic epithets related to their histories, their goals, and/or their capabilities.

She thanks the players for making the journey to [[#C4. Tser Pool (G)]]. If asked about [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s visit, she says only that each person’s future is their own to know, and that, while her duty binds her to seek the whispers of Fate for any who invoke her name, she is bound not to reveal what she sees to anyone else.

If [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]] is with the players in raven form, [[Madam Eva]] regards her with an emotion nearly resembling fondness and asks to inspect her. She strokes [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]]’s wings and notes that she once had a beloved pet raven named Turul long ago.

“I have only seen him once these past ten years, however,” [[Madam Eva|Eva]] adds, somewhat mournfully. “Doubtless, he has gone wild without me.” ([[Madam Eva]] is referring to the **Roc of Mount Ghakis**, which served her when she retained the mantle of [[The Ladies of the Fanes|The Seeker]] of [[The Faith of the Ladies Three]].)

If the players ask Eva about [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia#B3. Svalich Woods (C)|Dalvan's Corpse]], she shares only that he was a [[Barovians|Barovian]] named Dalvan Olensky who came to her tent in the aftermath of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s siege on [[the village of Barovia]], and that he insisted upon hearing— and then defying—his fate, a choice with tragic consequences. (As with [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], [[Madam Eva|Eva]] can’t disclose the nature or content of Dalvan’s foretelling.)

If the players ask [[Madam Eva]] to read their fortunes, or request her guidance on how to defeat [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], her face darkens, and she says, "You stand upon a precipice of a cliff whose base you cannot yet see. Do you understand what you ask of me?"

Regardless of the players' response, [[Madam Eva]] replies, shaking her head: "I will not do this thing for you—not yet. If you wish to pursue this path, however, come to the [[#C2. River Ivlis Crossroads (F)]] at midnight tonight. I shall await you there, by the gallows. Come alone—and do not allow yourselves to be followed." [[Madam Eva]] refuses to elaborate, and dismisses the players from her tent if they attempt to protest.

As the players prepare to leave, [[Madam Eva]] pauses and closes her eyes, though they flash wide open again soon after.

> [!cutscene] When they do, read:
> Madam Eva’s voice is a low hiss as she speaks, her silhouette dancing in the flickering candlelight. "A shadow is approaching my tent: a lone servant of Darkness. They seek knowledge of your future—secrets that I am sworn never to reveal to any but their keepers.
> 
> “Do not look, child, nor rush to greet them; if they learn of your true aspirations, all may be lost. Do not reveal, even, that you know of their true nature, for their master will know that I have told you, and his wrath will descend upon us all.
## C4c. Vistani Hospitality
---
Upon exiting [[Madam Eva]]’s tent, the players find two other [[Vistani]] waiting outside of the tent: a woman named [[Eliza]] and a man named [[Arturi Radanavich]]. [[Stanimir]] joins the group a few moments later.

Unless the players intervene, the conversation unfolds as follows:

- [[Eliza]] greets the players immediately, giving them a warm welcome to the [[#C4. Tser Pool (G)|Tser Pool Encampment]].
- As [[Stanimir]] approaches, [[Eliza]] clicks her tongue and scolds him for his lack of hospitality, noting that the players seem to have travelled a long way.
- [[Stanimir]] amusedly reminds [[Eliza]] that fate waits for no one, but nonetheless invites the players to rest their weary feet at the camp’s central fire, offering wine, food, and song should the players join.
- If the players accept and move to accompany [[Stanimir]], [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] hesitates, then asks if the players would mind if he accompanied them. He notes that he has heard that they have just arrived from [[The Village of Barovia|Barovia]], and he is curious to hear news from the village. (He adds, somewhat awkwardly, that it has been some time since he had last shared a [[Vistani#Beliefs and Superstitions|Vistani fire]], and apologizes for imposing upon them and the others.)

> [!example]- Arturi & Eliza
> **[[Arturi Radanavich]]**, a cursed Vistana, arrived at the Tser Pool encampment two weeks after Strahd's reawakening. (See **The Curse of [[Arturi Radanavich]]** below for more information about Arturi's presence in Barovia and his connection to [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten]].) [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] is a quiet, soft-spoken man in his late thirties with a distant, almost absent-minded countenance and a near-painful sincerity.
> 
> Meanwhile, **[[Eliza]]**, one of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s spies, has heard that outsiders have entered the pool from beyond the Mists, and hopes to glean information about their goals, capabilities, and weaknesses. ([[Eliza]] had hoped to eavesdrop on the players’ Tarokka reading as well, but was foiled by Madam [[Madam Eva|Eva]]’s foresight.)
> 
> In sharp contrast to Arturi, [[Eliza]] is a cheery, excitable woman in her early thirties, always glad to insert herself into a conversation with a brash or witty comment.

> [!tip]- The Curse of Arturi Radanavich
> **_Dark Beginnings._** Twenty years ago, when [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] Radanavich was only seventeen, several members of his extended family amongst the Radanavich caravan invited him on a “hunting trip.” Awkward, lonesome, and desperate for connection, [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] accepted their invitation gratefully.
> 
> It wasn’t long, however, before [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] learned the true nature of their hunt. His aunt, Madame Irene Radanavich and the leader of the caravan, had recently seen her son, Radu, gravely injured. When the [[Vistani]]’s treatments proved fruitless, Madame Radanavich had taken Radu to a healer in a nearby village—a doctor named [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rudolph van Richten]]. Radu, however, had died under [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]]’s care, and a vengeful and grieving Madame Radanavich sought to visit this pain upon [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]] in turn.
> 
> [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] felt bewildered and afraid—but each time he thought to open his mouth, he imagined the insults and jeers of his cousins or Aunt Irene’s smoldering glare. And so, [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] watched silently as his family kidnapped [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]]’s fourteen-year-old son, Erasmus, spirited him away to a darkened mire, and sold him to the vampire lord Baron Metus. The Radanaviches then fled through the Mists—to Barovia.
> 
> It wasn’t long after Erasmus was sold that [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]] tracked the [[Vistani]] caravan down, ambushing the d’Avenirs—a [[Vistani]] husband and wife who then traveled with the Radanaviches and had aided Madame Radanavich in her vengeance—and demanding to know where his son had been taken. [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] later learned that [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]] had spared the d’Avenirs’ lives—a mercy that would not last forever.
> 
> Three years later, [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]] returned, grim-faced and surrounded by a swarm of ravenous undead. His son Erasmus had died—transformed into a vampire spawn and killed by [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]]’s own hand. Torn by fury and grief, [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]] released the undead horde upon the Radanavich caravan, howling, “Undead take you as you have taken my son!”
> 
> [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] alone survived, hiding himself away in his grandmother’s magical trunk. When he finally emerged, hours later, he found the encampment shattered, his family slaughtered—and [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]] nowhere to be found.
> 
> **_Arturi's Curse._** [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] soon learned, however, that [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]]’s vengeful words had taken on a life of their own, clinging to him like a burial shroud. “Undead take you,” [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]] had promised—and so they did, pursuing [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] wherever he went. The [[Vistani]] banished him from their camps after dusk, naming him _mortu_, or “outcast,” a word that can also be more directly translated as “living dead.” No village gave [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] sanctuary; no town’s walls would protect him.
> 
> For eighteen years [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] evaded his eternal pursuers, even as he desperately searched for a way to escape the clutches of his curse. Finally, shortly after [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s reawakening, he returned to Barovia, where he sought the counsel of the Vistana seer [[Madam Eva]]. "Find the man who forged your fetters," she told him. "His final breath will set you free."
> 
> [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] has ranged across Barovia several times since then in search of [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]]. On one occasion, he even recovered a supply cache, containing a half-written manuscript and a small assortment of weapons. He has been unable, however, to locate the doctor himself.
> 
> [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] has often returned to [[Madam Eva]]'s camp to enjoy her hospitality—but stays no longer than dusk each time. For the walking dead never rest, and [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] dare not lead them to Tser Pool . . .
> 
> **Source:** Wise, David. _Van Richten's Guide to the Vistani._ Wizards of the Coast, 1995.

If the players make their way to the [[Vistani#Beliefs and Superstitions|Vistani fire]], [[Eliza]]—and [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]], if he is present—introduce themselves. [[Eliza]] also asks the players’ names in return. (If asked why he has not shared a [[Vistani#Beliefs and Superstitions|Vistani fire]] until recently, [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] winces and admits only that the situation is complicated.)
## C4d. The Dancing Fire
---
As dusk descends around the campfire, the [[Vistani]] serve the players a dinner of a hearty stew of rabbit, potatoes, turnips, lentils, and parsnips alongside hearty chunks of flatbread. As they eat, [[Eliza]] asks the players about their next destination. If the players note that they are headed toward [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] or otherwise indicate an interest in staying the night, [[Stanimir]] invites them to rest at the camp overnight, noting that the roads can be long and dangerous beyond [[Madam Eva]]’s wagons.

If he hasn’t already, [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] asks the players for news from [[The Village of Barovia|Barovia]], inquiring specifically whether they have encountered a man named [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rudolph van Richten]]. If asked about his interest, [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] notes quietly that [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]] is an acquaintance of his, and that he had recently heard a rumour that he had been seen traveling to Barovia. (This is a lie. A player who succeeds on a DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check discerns that [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] is speaking slightly too quickly. [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] doesn't reveal the truth if challenged, and instead merely shrugs and says, "Believe what you choose to believe.") [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] is unsure whether he believes [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]] to be dead, but suspects that he still lives—if for no other reason than that he has heard the old man is impressively hard to kill.

> [!warning]- Insight Checks
> Do not invite players to make Insight checks unprompted. Instead, allow players to ask for information regarding an NPC's body language or truthfulness before inviting them to make one.

After dinner, [[Stanimir]] cheerfully informs the players that, as guests at a [[Vistani#Beliefs and Superstitions|Vistani fire]], they are now expected to play the Game of Stories, and asks whether the players will accept. To play, each participant must put up a wager, which can be an object of small monetary, intellectual, or sentimental value. Each participant must then share a story to make a man “laugh or weep.” Each time a story is told, the other participants in the game must guess whether the story is truth, falsehood, or both. At the end of the game, the participant with the most correct guesses wins the pot.

If the players accept the challenge, [[Eliza]], [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]], and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] also offer to join the game. The participants’ wagers are as follows:

- **[[Stanimir]]** wagers a worn deck of Tarokka cards that once belonged to his late wife. (“They’ve sat unused and dusty in my wagon for long enough,” he says with a sad smile. “I think she’d like it if they were out in the world again.”)
- **[[Eliza]]** wagers a collapsible brass spyglass with a small, manoeuvrable mirror, allowing the user to peer around corners.
- **[[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]]** wagers a short manuscript on werewolves authored by [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten]].
- **[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]** wagers a painted wooden hairclip in the shape of a sunflower that she once wore as a child.
  
Give the players a few minutes away from the table to plan out their stories before the game begins.

> [!info]- *Campfire Reactions*
> In response to the players' stories, the participants of the Game of Stories vote as follows:
>
> - [[Stanimir]], believing that a grain of truth lies at the heart of every tale, votes nothing but True.
> - [[Eliza]], not one for half-truths, alternates between True and False.
> - [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]], cynical and distrusting, alternates between Half-True and False.
> - [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], quick to warm to the player, alternates between True and Half-True.

> [!tip]- Arturi's manuscript
> [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]]'s manuscript—authored by [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten]]—is handwritten and two pages long. It is titled "A Study of the Werewolf's Curse," and reads as follows:
>
>---
>
>Werewolves are among the most fearsome lycanthropes, bearing a curse as ancient as it is terrifying. For them, the affliction of lycanthropy transforms even the most civilized individual into a monstrous beast, warping the lines betwixt man and nature.
>
>In its humanoid form, a werewolf retains many of the characteristics of its original identity, save for certain nuances such as heightened senses, an explosive temper, and an odd preference for rare meats. Over time, subtle features that hint at their animalistic nature begin to manifest. Nevertheless, it is in their wolf and hybrid forms that the true horror of the curse is revealed. A werewolf's hybrid form is particularly terrifying, with a muscular humanoid body crowned by the head of a ravenous wolf. It is capable of wielding weapons, though its favoured means of attack are its devastating claws and powerful bite.
>
>Werewolves typically abandon civilization soon after their transformation. Those who reject the curse flee in fear of harming their loved ones, whereas those who accept it fear exposure and the repercussions of their violent deeds. Out in the wild, they form packs, living in cohesion with ordinary wolves and dire wolves alike.
>
>The most tragic aspect of lycanthropy is its transmission. A humanoid can contract this curse through a wound inflicted by a lycanthrope or through inheritance if one or both of its parents are lycanthropes.
>
>The cursed have two paths: they may resist the beast within or embrace it. Those who resist bear unending strain—until the rising full moon triggers a compulsory and horrific transformation. These individuals often experience bloody, haunting dreams: echoes of the carnage wrought in their madness.
>
>Some twisted souls, however, choose to accept their beastly nature. With time, they can master their abilities, calling upon the wolf's resilience and strength as they will. To do so, however, they must first perform a particular gruesome and foul act—one which I will decline to describe in these pages.
>
>One sure way to identify an afflicted individual is the presence of a perpetually raw, bloody wound: the scar of the initial curse transmission. This wound never fully heals until the curse is lifted.
>
>Beyond this mark, however, these creatures bear an extraordinary resilience. Conventional methods of harm prove ineffective in permanently subduing a werewolf. Only through the bite of silver or the chill of death's power can a werewolf be truly put to rest.
>
>A spell of removal can also cure an afflicted lycanthrope, though those who accept the beast may fight it bitterly. As for those unfortunate souls born under the curse, they are doomed to bear their affliction for life. As far as my research has shown, there exists no cure, no respite for such individuals. They are caught in an eternal struggle, forever haunted by the wolf within.
### Stanimir's Tale
[[Stanimir]] goes first, delivering the same tale as described in The Dancing Fire (p. 20). Throughout his tale, the players can notice [[Stanimir]] using the _major image_ spell to create the shapes in the flames.

> [!Cutscene] As Stanimir begins telling his tale, read:
> [[Stanimir]] fills his mouth with wine, then spits into the fire. The flames turn from orange to green. As they dance and sway, a dark shape appears in the bonfire's core.
> 
> "We come from an ancient land whose name is long forgotten—a land of kings. Our enemies forced us from our homes, and now we wander the lost roads."
> 
> The dark shape in the fire takes the form of a man being knocked from his horse, a spear piercing his side.
> 
> [[Stanimir]] continues. "One night, a wounded soldier staggered into our camp and collapsed. We nursed his terrible injury and quenched his thirst with wine. He survived. When we asked him who he was, he wouldn't say. All he wanted was to return home, but we were deep in the land of his enemies. We took him as one of our own and followed him back toward his homeland. His enemies hunted him. They said he was a prince, yet we didn't give him up, even when their assassins fell upon us like wolves."
> 
> Deep in the bonfire, you see the dark figure standing with sword drawn, fighting off a host of shadowy shapes.
> 
> "This man of royal blood fought to protect us, as we protected him. We bore him safely to his home, and he thanked us. He said, 'I owe you my life. Stay as long as you wish, leave when you choose, and know that you will always be safe here.'"
> 
> The figure in the dancing fire vanquishes its final foe, then disperses in a cloud of smoke and embers.

When his tale has ended and all participants have made their guesses—[[Eliza]] and [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] going last, with [[Eliza]] voting “True” and [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] voting “Half-True”—[[Stanimir]] reveals that his story was indeed a true tale of the [[Vistani]] people, and that the wounded prince lived on as a friend to the [[Vistani]], even when his heart was led astray by shadows and mist. (If asked, [[Stanimir]] admits that the prince was [[Strahd von Zarovich]] in the days before he came to Barovia, and that his promise to the [[Vistani]] is why they remain in the valley to this day, “without fear or favour.”)
### Eliza's Tale
After one of the players has taken their turn, [[Eliza]] stands and offers to go next.

> [!cutscene] When Eliza tells her tale, read:
> “It is said that within each raven flutters a lost soul, and that each raven’s song tells a tale of ages past. They whisper, so listen closely.”
> 
> She takes a deep breath; when she speaks again, her voice is quiet, with an eerie, melodic quality to it.
> 
> “Sing, ravens, of Barovia, birthed from the mists and bathed in twilight. Sing of Lugdana, the Morninglord’s stalwart, dawn-touched foe to the deep-lurking dark. The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind, her radiant testament, the warrior’s beacon of faithful resolve.
> 
> “Sing, ravens, of Chernovog’s rise, named Green-God and Demon-Lord upon Yester Hill. Lugdana, gray-haired, weary of battle, her longsword and shield yet polished and ready. Guided through shadows, toward sacred ground, she clashed with the demon, their tempest-like dance.
> 
> “Sing, ravens, of Lugdana’s last fury, of Ravenkind’s token now blazing with light. The battle’s tide turning, a hero’s brave cry, a final onslaught with divinity’s grace. The Demon-Lord banished, the warrior now fell, the wound at her side gouged too deep to bear.
> 
> “Sing, ravens, of light’s final moments, a shadow descending from radiance on high. Sing of the angel, black-feathered and beaked, the Morninglord’s angel reclaiming its gift. The Symbol retaken, in ravens’ claws held.
> 
> “Sing, ravens; you are the keepers, the watchers, the tellers of stories untold. Sing, ravens, of Lugdana’s memory, the shadows that lurk, and heroes to come.”

When her tale has ended and all participants have made their guesses—[[Stanimir]] and [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] going last, with [[Stanimir]] voting “True” and [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] voting “False”—[[Eliza]] reveals that her story was half-true.

[[Lugdana]] was indeed a paladin of the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]] who bore the legendary _[[Holy Symbol of Ravenkind]]_, which was a platinum amulet shaped like a sunburst, with an enormous ruby embedded at its centre. According to legend, the symbol was given to [[Lugdana]] by an angel in the guise of a raven. [[Eliza]] notes with a chuckle, however, that no one knows what happened to the Symbol after [[Lugdana]] fell at Yester Hill, nor where it resides today.
### Arturi's Tale
After three of the players have gone, [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] then stand and shares their tale.

> [!cutscene] When Arturi tells their tale, read:
> There once was a Fox, renowned for his wisdom and skill, who dwelled with his kit in the misted woods. On a cold, moonlit night, a pair of Sparrows brought him their child, the tendrils of Death clutching its shivering body. The Fox took the chick into his den, but for all his knowledge, he could not cure its ailment, and it breathed its last in his paws.
> 
> Driven mad in their grief, the vengeful Sparrows, aided by four of their kin, stole the Fox's kit in the night. They delivered him to the Wolf, who had long hungered for the taste of fox-flesh. The Wolf devoured the kit, and the Sparrows departed to return to their flock.
> 
> When the Fox found what the Sparrows had done, rage clutched his own heart. In his cunning, he knew that the Rats, in their burrows beneath the earth, had always despised the songs of the Sparrows far above. The Fox descended to the kingdom of the Rats, and he promised them a forest free of the songs of the Sparrows. Intrigued, the Rats agreed.
> 
> The Rats could not find the Sparrows' nest alone. But the crafty Fox could, and as the Sparrows slumbered in the hollow of a great oak, the Rats fell upon them to feast with tooth and claw. For the crimes of six, the flock perished, with nary an egg spared.
> 
> The misted wood is darkened, now, and the trees no longer sing with the songs of the Sparrows. But some say that the Rats hunt still—that a lone chick yet escaped their clutches, and that one day, they will find it, and gobble it up like the rest.

When his tale has ended and all participants have made their guesses—[[Stanimir]] and [[Eliza]] going last, with [[Stanimir]] voting “True” and [[Eliza]] voting “False”—[[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] reveals that his story was true. He politely declines, however, to reveal anything further, noting only with a sad smile that "A story cannot truly be told until it has ended."
### Ireena's Tale
After all of the players have gone, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] (if present) then stands and shares her tale.

> [!cutscene] When [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] tells her tale, read:
> "When I was a child, my father took me and my brother to a vast, tranquil lake. I remember the sand beneath my bare feet, and the lapping of the waves against the shore.
> 
> "But then, something broke the silence—a low growl that echoed through the wind. As I turned, I saw a beast emerge from the fog: a wolf, far larger than any I'd ever seen. I still remember its eyes—yellow, cold, and hungry.
> 
> "My father screamed for me to run. I took off for the woods, and the wolf followed, its snarls echoing through the underbrush. I remember branches whipping against my face, thorns cutting at my feet as my legs burned and my breath grew ragged, but my fear drove me forward.
> 
> "It was only much later, when my heart had quieted in my chest and the wolf's footsteps had faded into silence, that I finally allowed myself to stop. By then, though, the woods were strange to me, and my father's shouts had faded.
> 
> "A heavy mist had descended around me, and shadowed shapes lurked in every corner. I stepped forward, one hand reaching fearfully into the fog—and a wolf made of mist leapt forth, its jaws opened wide to devour me. And then—everything went black.
> 
> "The next thing I remembered, I awoke in my own bed, my father's humming echoing from the kitchen. I don't know how I got there, or what became of the wolf, but I can still remember its teeth as clearly as ever."

When her tale has ended and all participants have made their guesses—[[Stanimir]] voting “True” and [[Eliza]] and [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] voting “False”—[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] reveals that her story was false. With a quiet laugh, she shares that the story is a dream that she’s had since childhood, noting that there are no lakes near [[the village of Barovia]] and that she’d never seen a **dire wolf** until recently.

If challenged on his vote, [[Stanimir]] merely says, with a mysterious smile, that many dreams have a kernel of truth. He then thanks [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] for sharing her tale.
### Arturi Departs
When the game ends, [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] bids the players farewell and departs from the camp. If asked why, he shares, with a sad smile, that the camp is in danger each moment he lingers there after dark. "I have been selfish tonight," he murmurs, "and pushed my fortunes as far as I dare. But I dare not remain any longer, for fear of the terror that might follow."

A player who succeeds on a DC 12 Charisma (Persuasion) check can convince [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] to share that the undead pursue him wherever he goes, and that they have haunted him each night for the past eighteen years. "A man once vowed that undead shall take me," he says. "And although they have not yet succeeded, they have never failed to try." He declines to explain further, asserting sadly: "Some tales wound the teller. Please, ask no more."

[[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] refuses any offers to defend him, and slips away into the night, eventually settling amidst the boughs of a tall tree two miles from the encampment. The undead then emerge as follows:

- Thirty minutes after [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] arrives, twelve **zombies** arrive to mill about the base of the tree.
- Two hours later, five **ghouls** arrive to claw and howl at the trunk of the tree.
- Two hours later, three **ghasts** arrive to join the ghouls.
- Two hours later, four **wights** emerge silently to stand guard around the base of the tree.

The undead vanish into the woods shortly before dawn.
## C4e. Return to the River Ivlis Crossroads
---
The journey from the [[#C4. Tser Pool (G)|Tser Pool Encampment]] to the [[#C2. River Ivlis Crossroads (F)|River Ivlis Crossroads]] is one-and-a-half miles long and takes thirty minutes. Players who attempt to conceal their movements from [[Eliza]], [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s spy in the camp, must succeed on a DC 11 Dexterity (Stealth) check or take other covert action to do so.
### Traveling to the Crossroads 

> [!cutscene] As the players make the journey to the crossroads, read:
> 
> A pallid moon hangs low in the sky, casting a weak, silvery glow upon the mist-shrouded landscape below. Ancient trees loom on either side of the muddy road, their gnarled branches reaching out like skeletal fingers.
> 
> As the witching hour approaches, an eerie stillness descends. Even the leaves cease their rustling, leaving the squelch of your boots through mud the only lingering sound.

If the players failed to conceal their departure, any players with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 11 or greater realize they're being followed.

> [!cutscene] If they do realize, read:
> The sound of a snapping twig cuts through the silence like shattering glass. A bush behind you rustles—then abruptly falls still.

The rustling bush hides the [[Vistani]] **bandit** [[Eliza]]. If the players disregard her, she continues to shadow the players as they approach the crossroads. Otherwise, if the players confront her, she reacts as follows:

**If the players call out to [[Eliza]]**, she remains hidden and doesn't respond.

**If the players find [[Eliza]]'s hiding spot**, she steps from the underbrush with her hands raised in a gesture of peace. She reassures the players that she meant them no harm, and insists that she followed them out of curiosity for their night-time travels. "Out and about at midnight—at a time when all but monsters fear to tread?" she breathes, her eyes glinting. "One might think you were _up to_ something—and a storyteller can always use more tales."

[[Eliza]] hopes to travel with the players openly to their destination. If refused, she "agrees" to return to [[#C4. Tser Pool (G)|Tser Pool]], but secretly loops back to follow the players' tracks. If the players attempt to convince her that any such endeavour would be fruitless and succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check, however, [[Eliza]] returns to [[#C4. Tser Pool (G)|Tser Pool]] and remains there for the night.

**If the players threaten [[Eliza]]**, she immediately surrenders, throwing herself on their mercy. If they succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check, she reveals that she "reports to the lord of the castle." If asked why she serves [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], her eyes glint with a hint of fanaticism as she breathlessly avows that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] is—or should be—the "king" of the [[Vistani]]. "He is the one who brought us home," she whispers reverently. "We delivered him from death, and, in gratitude, he delivered us from exile."

> [!tip]- Eliza's Fanaticism
> [[Eliza]] freely admits that few [[Vistani]] agree with her beliefs or loyalty to [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]—a fact that drives her to curse the "ungrateful" and "faithless" among them. Although she doesn't believe Barovia is the ancestral home of the [[Vistani]], [[Eliza]] believes it to be a new home that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] found for them.

**If the players attack [[Eliza]]**, she attempts to flee into the woods. If allowed to do so, [[Eliza]] immediately moves to return to [[Castle Ravenloft]], and doesn't return to [[#C4. Tser Pool (G)|Tser Pool]] that night. If the players give chase, run the chase as described in Chases (_Dungeon Master's Guide_, p. 252), using the **Wilderness Chase Complications** table as follows:

- Use a **swarm of biting midges** (using the statistics for a **swarm of wasps**) for the **swarm of insects**
- Use a stampede of spooked **elk** for the stampede of spooked animals
- Use a **giant spider** for the creature indigenous to the area

> [!info]- Chase Scenes - Quick Reference
> If a Skill Challenge doesn't quite fit with a Chase, as with the chase of [[Eliza]], the DMG has rules explicitly for Chase Scene, detailed below.
> #### Beginning a Chase
> ---
> A chase requires a quarry and at least one pursuer. Any participants not already in initiative order must roll initiative. As in combat, each participant in the chase can take one action and move on its turn. The chase ends when one side drops out or the quarry escapes.
> 
> When a chase begins, determine the starting distance between the quarry and the pursuers. Track the distance between them, and designate the pursuer closest to the quarry as the lead. The lead pursuer might change from round to round.
>#### Running the Chase
>---
>Participants in the chase are strongly motivated to use the Dash action every round. Pursuers who stop to cast spells and make attacks run the risk of losing their quarry, and a quarry that does so is likely to be caught.
>##### Dashing
>
>During the chase, a participant can freely use the Dash action a number of times equal to 3 + its Constitution modifier. Each additional Dash action it takes during the chase requires the creature to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution check at the end of its turn or gain one level of [exhaustion](https://2014.5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_phb).
>
>A participant drops out of the chase if its [exhaustion](https://2014.5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_phb) reaches level 5, since its speed becomes 0. A creature can remove the levels of [exhaustion](https://2014.5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#exhaustion_phb) it gained during the chase by finishing a short or long rest.
>##### Spells and Attacks
>
>A chase participant can make attacks and cast spells against other creatures within range. Apply the normal rules for cover, terrain, and so on to the attacks and spells.
>
>Chase participants can't normally make opportunity attacks against each other, since they are all assumed to be moving in the same direction at the same time.
>
>However, participants can still be the targets of opportunity attacks from creatures not participating in the chase. For example, adventurers who chase a thief past a gang of thugs in an alley might provoke opportunity attacks from the thugs.
>#### Ending a Chase
>---
>A chase ends when one side or the other stops, when the quarry escapes, or when the pursuers are close enough to their quarry to catch it.
>
>If neither side gives up the chase, the quarry makes a Dexterity (Stealth) check at the end of each round, after every participant in the chase has taken its turn. The result is compared to the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the pursuers. If the quarry consists of multiple creatures, they all make the check.
>
>If the quarry is never out of the lead pursuer's sight, the check fails automatically. Otherwise, if the result of the quarry's check is greater than the highest passive score, that quarry escapes. If not, the chase continues for another round.
>
>The quarry gains advantage or disadvantage on its check based on prevailing circumstances, as shown in the Escape Factors table. If one or more factors give the quarry both advantage and disadvantage on its check, the quarry has neither, as usual.
> #### Escape Factors
>
>|Factor|Check Has...|
>|---|---|
>|Quarry has many things to hide behind|Advantage|
>|Quarry is in a very crowded or noisy area|Advantage|
>|Quarry has few things to hide behind|Disadvantage|
>|Quarry is in an uncrowded or quiet area|Disadvantage|
>|The lead pursuer is a ranger or has proficiency in Survival|Disadvantage|
>
>Other factors might help or hinder the quarry's ability to escape, at your discretion. For example, a quarry with a faerie fire spell cast on it might have disadvantage on checks made to escape because it's much easier to spot.
>
>Escape doesn't necessarily mean the quarry has outpaced its pursuers. For example, in an urban setting, escape might mean the quarry ducked into a crowd or slipped around a corner, leaving no clue as to where it went.
>#### Chase Complications
>---
>As with any good chase scene, complications can arise to make a chase more pulse-pounding. The Urban Chase Complications table and the Wilderness Chase Complications table provide several examples. Complications occur randomly. Each participant in the chase rolls a d20 at the end of its turn. Consult the appropriate table to determine whether a complication occurs. If it does, it affects the next chase participant in the initiative order, not the participant who rolled the die. The participant who rolled the die or the participant affected by the complication can spend inspiration to negate the complication.
>
>Characters can create their own complications to shake off pursuers (for example, casting the web spell in a narrow alleyway). Adjudicate these as you see fit.

While fleeing through the woods, [[Eliza]] has half cover from any player at least 30 feet away, and three-quarters cover from any player at least 60 feet away.

**If the players attempt to conceal their tracks from [[Eliza]]**, they can do so by traveling off-road and succeeding on a DC 11 Dexterity (Stealth) check, followed by a DC 11 Wisdom (Survival) check. Players who depart from the road in this way encounter a **will-o'-wisp** as described in [[Random Encounters#Will-o'-Wisp|Will-o'-Wisp (p. 33)]].
### The March of the Dead

> [!cutscene] When the players arrive at the River Ivlis Crossroads, read:
> The well-worn path returns to the crossroad, now illuminated beneath the pale, sickly light of the moon. Across the road, the mist-shrouded headstones seem to hunker down in the gloom beside the old wooden gallows, whose frayed rope dangles lifelessly in the still air.
> 
> A squat, cloaked silhouette stands beside the gallows—waiting.

The silhouette is [[Madam Eva]]. She does not answer if called out to, and waits for the players to approach her. When they do, she whispers to them, her voice rasping like a chill wind: "_What did I say to you before you departed my tent?_" If the players respond accurately, [[Madam Eva]] nods, assured of their identities.

> [!example]- Eliza's Flight
> If the players failed to stop [[Eliza]] from following them, [[Eliza]] is hiding behind a patch of underbrush to the north of the crossroads, watching them silently. If she is, [[Madam Eva]]'s eyes flare wide, and she exhales sharply. "Fools!" she breathes. "You were followed—dispatch her, or all is lost!" She then gestures toward [[Eliza]]'s hiding place.
> 
> Once noticed, [[Eliza]] immediately attempts to flee into the woods, beginning with a 30-foot head start. If allowed to do so, [[Eliza]] immediately moves to return to [[Castle Ravenloft]], and doesn't return to Tser Pool that night. If the players give chase, run the chase as described in Chases (_Dungeon Master's Guide_, p. 252), using the **Wilderness Chase Complications** table as follows:
>
>- Use a **swarm of biting midges** (using the statistics for a **swarm of wasps**) for the **swarm of insects**
>- Use a stampede of spooked **elk** for the stampede of spooked animals
>- Use a **giant spider** for the creature indigenous to the area
>
>While fleeing through the woods, [[Eliza]] has half cover from any player at least 30 feet away, and three-quarters cover from any player at least 60 feet away.
>
>If [[Eliza]] is caught, [[Madam Eva]] is insistent that she be killed and thrown into the River Ivlis, "lest she report what she has seen and heard to her master." If challenged, [[Madam Eva]] coldly replies that "there can be no equivocation when Fate itself balances upon the precipice."
If further questioned, [[Madam Eva]] holds up a hand, then silently turns to face the unmarked graveyard near the gallows. The March of the Dead, as described in March of the Dead (p. 48), begins shortly thereafter.

If further questioned, [[Madam Eva]] holds up a hand, then silently turns to face the unmarked graveyard near the gallows. The March of the Dead, as described in March of the Dead (p. 48), begins shortly thereafter.

> [!example]- March of the Dead
> Every night at midnight, one hundred spirits rise from the unmarked cemetery on the [[#C2. River Ivlis Crossroads (F)]] and march up the Old Svalich Road to [[Castle Ravenloft]].
> 
>> [!cutscene] When the March of the Dead begins, read:
> > An eerie green light suffuses the graveyard. From this light emerges a ghostly procession. Wavering images of doughty women toting greatswords, woodwise men with slender bows, dwarves with glittering axes, and archaically dressed mages with beards and strange, pointed hats—all these and more march forth from the graveyard, their numbers growing by the second.
> 
> These aren't the spirits of the people buried here, but of previous adventurers who died trying to destroy [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]. Every night, the ghostly adventurers attempt to complete their quest, and each night they fail. They have no interest in the living and can't be hit, damaged, or turned. They will not communicate with the characters.
> 
> Once they reach the [[Castle Ravenloft|castle]], the spirits march straight to the chapel ([area K15](https://2014.5e.tools/adventure.html#cos,5,k15.%20chapel,0)) and up the high tower stair ([area K18](https://2014.5e.tools/adventure.html#cos,5,k18.%20high%20tower%20staircase,0)) to the top of the tower ([area K59](https://2014.5e.tools/adventure.html#cos,5,k59.%20high%20tower%20peak,0)). There, they throw themselves down the shaft toward the crypts ([area K84](https://2014.5e.tools/adventure.html#cos,5,k84.%20catacombs,0)), where they disappear.
> ^MarchoftheDead

Once the March has begun, [[Madam Eva]] informs the players: "Each spirit in this march shares a common trait. Can you suppose what that might be?" If the players answer correctly, she then asks, "Where do you suppose they might be headed?"

Regardless of the players' answer, [[Madam Eva]] then shares the information about the March provided in [[#^MarchoftheDead|March of the Dead]], either in response to the players' questions or of her own initiative once the March has fully departed the graveyard.

"This is the precipice you walk," she warns them once the March has departed. "There are many paths among the webs of Fate, but I can only see what may be—not what will. I can tell you what you _must_ do, but I cannot ensure that you will succeed. For if you fail, this shall be your resting place—a place without legacy, glory, or love. Do you understand?"

Regardless of the players' answer, [[Madam Eva]] fixates them with a steady gaze. "If you wish to put aside this mission, no soul could blame you. There is no shame in flight from a foe that no others have defeated. If you wish me to read your futures, I can read your palms, or gaze into my crystal ball. I can tell you the face of your true love, the path to good health in your elder years, or the success you might find in a trade of profession." She pauses, then adds, her voice nearly a whisper: "Or I can read the cards—and set you upon a path that ends only when your foe is vanquished—or you are. The choice is yours."

If the players insist upon a desire to defeat [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], [[Madam Eva]] nods. "Very well," she says. "Then let us begin."
## C4f. The Tarokka Reading
---
[[Madam Eva]] begins the Tarokka reading by seating herself upon the cemetery earth, reaching into her cloak, and removing three old candles, which she stakes into the ground and lights with a wave of her hand. She then removes a deck of Tarokka cards, which she sets upon the ground between the candles.

> [!cutscene] Read:
> Her old hands working deftly, the ancient seer removes fourteen cards from the top of the deck, setting them aside. The remaining cards, she shuffles nimbly twice, three times, four.

As she shuffles the deck, the players notice a velvet pouch upon the ground beside her that wasn't present a moment before. [[Madam Eva]] meets their eyes, then cackles quietly. "The task you seek of me is no small boon," she murmurs. "In exchange, I would ask a boon of my own."

If the players accept [[Madam Eva]]'s request or inquire further, she informs them that the pouch contains ten gold pieces. "My great-grand-niece, Arabelle, will celebrate her tenth nameday in two days' time," she says. "For this momentous occasion, I wish to provide her a gift—but in my old age, I am quite unable to make the journey myself."

[[Madam Eva]] asks the players to use the funds in the pouch to purchase a toy for [[Arabelle]] at Blinsky Toys in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]—Blinsky’s, she notes fondly, are [[Arabelle]]’s favorites—and deliver the toy to the [[Vistani]] encampment to the southwest of [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] by noon on [[Arabelle]]’s nameday. She adds that the players are welcome to keep any change as payment for their efforts.

[[Madam Eva|Eva]] adds, with a cryptic smile, that the players may enjoy speaking with [[Arabelle]], as she is “a most interesting child”—and that the players may find befriending her family a gift in itself. (If the players ask, [[Madam Eva|Eva]] shares only that [[Arabelle]]'s father, [[Luvash]], is the leader of the Vallakian [[Vistani]] encampment, and his brother [[Arrigal]] a "perceptive and intelligent man.")

If the players accept [[Madam Eva]]'s task, she nods approvingly. She then begins the Tarokka reading.

> [!cutscene] When the reading begins, read:
> [[Madam Eva]] sets both decks upon the earth before her. Closing her eyes, she places her right hand over the surface of the larger deck. The crimson flames dim and swirl in eldritch patterns as her lips move silently, a distant tension spreading through the air. The sound of the rustling trees begins to dim, the external world growing mute and insubstantial as the space within grows more solid—more real.
> 
> Slowly, reverently, the crone draws three cards from the top of the deck, laying them face down separately on the ground, with the second laid between and above its partners. She then moves to the smaller deck, drawing two more cards. The first, she places below the first three, forming a cross. The second, she places in the centre.
> 
> The shadows of the headstones around her sway like silhouettes, leaning in toward the cards like anxious watchers—yet the air in the cemetery is perfectly still. No light intrudes besides the light of the three candles; no voice rings out in the silence. Shadows and mist swirl beyond the graves, where the darkness of deepest night dwells—but here, at its center, light yet reigns.
> 
> The crone then moves her wrinkled hand to the left-most card—the first. She closes her eyes and tilts her head, as if listening to an unspoken word. The arcane lights swirl and then shift, their colors changing to a deep, piercing blue.
> 
> "This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy."
> 
> She flips the card.
> 
> The cerulean light dances across its surface, revealing an illustration of a smirking guardsman looking up at a haughty priest, the priest’s pointing fingers mere inches from the guardsman’s nose as the guardsman readies a wickedly curved dagger behind his back. “The Nine of Glyphs—the Traitor.” Her dark pupils shift from side to side, as though reading from an unseen text. "I see the ancient foe of an old and noble house. The lost soul will lead you to him."
> 
> She moves her hand to the second card, this one at the top of the cross. As she closes her eyes and listens once more, the candlelight flares, its color bursting into a fierce, cheery yellow.
> 
> "This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope." She flips the card.
> 
> This time, the light reveals a new illustration: an armoured warrior clutching a cracked iron sword and a leather-bound wooden shield, his face obscured by a heavy iron helmet. “The Five of Swords—the Myrmidon.” Her eyes stare deep into the darkness that lurks beyond the candlelight. "Look for a den of wolves in the hills overlooking a mountain lake. The treasure belongs to Mother Night."
> 
> She moves her hand to the third card, at the right arm of the cross, her eyelids closing like a trance, her lips pursed in quiet contemplation. The candlelight vanishes, for a heartbeat—and then returns in a nova of fierce, burning white, so pure and strong and clean that it hurts to look at, burns to see—
> 
> [[Madam Eva]]'s eyes snap open, burning with a fierce determination.
> 
> "This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight." She flips the card.
> 
> The light reveals a third illustration: a solemn-faced man clad in holy vestments, one hand clutching the chain of a bronze censer that billows with burning smoke. “The Eight of Glyphs—the Bishop.” The crone's voice is strong with purpose. "What you seek lies in an amber prison, where the devil fears to tread," she intones, her eyes narrowing. "This weapon is long hidden. The house of the fallen dragon can lead you there."
> 
> She moves to the fourth card, at the bottom of the cross, and listens once more, tracing small circles across its back as she hums a contemplative note. The magic flames leap and dance upon their wicks, now casting swirling violet embers into the air as the graves beyond shimmer with a twilit glow.
> 
> "This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness."
> 
> She flips the card.
> 
> This time, the illustration revealed is a quiet graveyard choked with fog, its entrance sealed with a sharp iron fence. "The Mists." Madam Eva leans forward. "A Vistana wanders this land alone, searching for her mentor. She does not stay in one place for long. Seek her out at Saint Markovia's abbey, near the mists."
> 
> Finally, she moves her hand to the fifth card—and nearly recoils, her brow furrowing until the wrinkles split her forehead like a trench. Behind her, shadows encircle the candlelight until the light is very nearly swallowed by the creeping dark. When next she speaks, Madam Eva's rasping voice is scarce above a whisper.
> 
> "Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. When the hour of judgment arrives, this card will lead you to him!"
> 
> Her hand trembles above the card for a silent moment—and then deft, ancient fingers reveal its opposite side.
> 
> In the darkness, the fifth and final illustration is only barely visible through the smoke and unnatural murk. Upon the card's surface dwells a depiction of a crowned, grinning emperor clad in royal finery and reaching for a goblet of wine—though his limbs are wooden puppet’s limbs, lashed to corded strings that disappear into the darkness overhead.
> 
> Madam Eva slowly exhales. "The Marionette." She rasps. "Look to great heights. Find the beating heart of the castle. He waits nearby."
> 
> As the last syllable passes her lips, the old woman freezes—and then rocks backwards, her eyes rolling until their whites gleam like pearls in the darkness—and then she snaps back, the candlelight burning down to its ordinary crimson glow.
> 
> The sound of the natural world returns—the whispering of the wind through the trees, the distant hooting of an owl, and the faraway lapping of the Ivlis River against its banks. Silver moonlight once again pierces the cemetery's edge, and you feel yourselves breathe for the first time since the reading began.
> 
> Madam Eva says nothing. She only regards you silently with dark, heavy eyes.

[[Madam Eva]] refuses to elaborate on the players’ readings or provide any additional information or assistance. If asked to, she says only, “The threads of Fate cannot be beckoned like a servant or conjured like a magician’s trick. I see only what the cards show me, and no more.”

[[Madam Eva]] dismisses the players from her presence once she has completed the Tarokka reading, instructing them to return to [[#C4. Tser Pool (G)|Tser Pool]] and to "tell no servant of Strahd of what they have just heard."

[[Madam Eva]] declines to return with the players, preferring instead to linger at the crossroads. If asked why, she shares only that the place holds "special memories" for her, and that she will return to [[#C4. Tser Pool (G)|Tser Pool]] when she is ready. "Fear not," she rasps, a twinkle of amusement in her eyes. "I have little to fear from the creatures that prowl these woods, I assure you." If the players depart the crossroads and later return, they find that [[Madam Eva]] has vanished.

> [!hint]- Why Madam Eva Remains
> Adventurers who sought to kill [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] are not the only ones buried at this cemetery. [[Madam Eva]]'s mother, the Vistana with whom [[King Barov II]] had an affair, is buried in the woods a short distance away from the gallows. (It is common for [[Vistani]] to bury their dead at crossroads, believing that doing so frees the spirit to guide others who follow the paths they once travelled.)

> [!warning]- Wandering Players
> Exploration in this campaign is intentional. Players won’t find much by wandering aimlessly; without clear leads, meaningful discoveries such as the _Holy Symbol of Ravenkind_ or Amber Temple can take days or even weeks. To progress, the players must uncover clues and recognize the signs that point the way.

**_[[Getting Started#Level breakdown|Milestone]]_**. Receiving the Tarokka reading completes a story milestone. When the party departs the crossroads, award each player 500 XP.
## C4g. Departing Tser Pool
---
When the players awaken at [[#C4. Tser Pool (G)|Tser Pool]] the following morning, [[Stanimir]] invites them to break their fast with him around the cold fire. Breakfast, which [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] attends if able, includes cornmeal polenta, stuffed cabbage rolls, and fried bread. (If her treachery was not revealed the previous night, [[Eliza]] cheerfully joins the players for breakfast as well.)

If the players attempt to speak with [[Madam Eva]] again before departing, [[Stanimir]] warns them that "the old woman" is asleep, and does not wish to be disturbed. If the players attempt to enter her tent, they find her asleep on a pallet beside her table.
# C5. The Skeletal Rider

When the players return to the [[#C2. River Ivlis Crossroads (F)|River Ivlis Crossroads]] after receiving the Tarokka reading, they encounter a skeletal rider, as described in [[Random Encounters#Skeletal Rider|Skeletal Rider]], which approaches from the western road and continues toward [[the village of Barovia]]. If the players saw Dalvan Olensky’s corpse upon entering Barovia, they notice that the rider’s clothing is recognizably similar to his.

> [!example]- Following the Rider
> If followed, the rider continues to ignore the players. After traveling a short distance down the road, it turns south down an old hunting path into the woods, which it follows east toward Barovia's eastern border. (The rider is roaming randomly, and has no particular destination.)
# C6. The Watchtower

> [!cutscene] When the players travel west from the River Ivlis Crossroads, read:
> You leave the crossroads behind and resume your westward journey. You follow the road as it bends around, then ascends the cliff, trudging up its steep, rocky incline.
> 
> The fog is thick here, obscuring the top of the cliff overhead. The road itself grows narrow and treacherous, with loose stones and deep ruts that make it difficult to maintain your footing.
> 
> Soon enough, though, the road levels out, continuing past a ruined three-story watchtower perched atop the edge of the cliff.
> 
> The tower's old stone walls are covered in moss and ivy, its rotten wooden door hanging off its hinges. Nearby, two fresh graves sit against the road. An animal's corpse seems to lie in the tall grass not far away.

Pause to allow the players to act or react. If the players remain silent, continue to [[#C7. The Highroad]] below. Otherwise, allow the players to explore the area.
## The Watchtower
---
The ruined watchtower was built as a lookout post by [[the Order of the Silver Dragon]] long ago. It has the same structure as the Guard Tower (p. 157) at Tsolenka Pass, with the following changes:

- The tower door has been half-pulled from its hinges and can be opened easily.
- The temperature and wind in the tower are far less severe.
- There is no dire wolf's head mounted above the hearth.
- There are neither statues nor skeletons atop the battlements.

If the players explore the watchtower, they find a broken silver pendant carved to resemble a dragon lying on the ground of the first floor, close to the entrance. The pendant is always cold to the touch.

> [!item]- Broken Silver Dragon Pendant
> Mundane, Jewellery 
> 
> ---
> A small broken silver pendant carved to resemble a dragon that is is always cold to the touch.
> ^BrokenSilverDragonPendant

From atop the battlements of the watchtower, the players can see Tser Falls to the northwest and [[#C4. Tser Pool (G)]] to the northeast. To the south, above and beyond the slopes of Mount Ghakis, they can see only an impenetrable wall of thick, grey fog.
## The Graves
---
The two graves hold the remains of two [[Barovians|Barovian]] refugees who were slain by wolves during the journey to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] some time ago. A DC 12 Wisdom (Survival) check reveals that the graves are no more than a few weeks old.

Small pebbles have been arranged in the soil atop each grave to form the shape of a rising sunburst.
## The Corpse
---
The corpse belongs to a wolf killed by spears and crossbow bolts, and has mostly rotted away. The [[Barovians|Barovian]] refugees left it here after slaying it and driving off the other members of its pack.
# C7. The Highroad

The journey from the [[#C2. River Ivlis Crossroads (F)]] to Tser Falls is seven-and-a-half miles long, or two-and-a-half hours.
## C7a. The Ravine
---
> [!cutscene] As the players continue down the road, read:
> You continue down the winding mountain road, the jagged peaks looming ominously through the fog far above.
> 
> The air grows colder as the road passes through a dark evergreen forest, the thick canopy once more blocking out much of the sky's dim light. Here, the road grows narrow, its edges passing above steep, craggy slopes as it winds around a mountain spur. The only sounds that follow you are the crunching of fallen leaves and an occasional rustling in the underbrush.

If one of the players has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher, or if one of the players makes a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check, they notice something else.

> [!cutscene] If they do, add:
> As your footsteps squelch into the old, muddy road, you glimpse a flicker of movement in the underwood: a flash of gray fur, amber eyes, and sharp, white teeth. Then, as soon as it appeared, it vanishes, skulking back into the shadows.

The movement belongs to a **wolf**, which swiftly retreats into the woods. Its five **wolf** packmates are not far behind, keeping a distance of two hundred feet as they stalk the players through the woods.

> [!cutscene] If the players continue, read:
> As the road curves around the edge of the mountain, the right-hand cliffs fall away, leaving a sheer drop to a wooded ravine below. The road, now barely ten feet wide, bends up ahead, doubling back around this ravine before plunging dramatically and winding around a smaller mountain peak.

If one of the players has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher, or if one of the players makes a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check, they notice something else.

> [!cutscene] If they do, add:
> You see three gray-furred shadows dart through the underbrush ahead. Three more flicker at the edge of your vision, just behind you.

If one of the players has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 18 or higher, or if one of the players makes a successful DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check, they gleam the following info.

> [!cutscene] If they do, add:
> Two more lurk in the ravine nearly fifty feet below, keeping pace with your movements as they cling to the shadows of the crags.

If the players pause, proceed, or attack, the six wolves in the woods strike. 

> [!cutscene] Read:
> Six snarling shadows launch from the underbrush, fangs bared and claws outstretched!

The two wolves at the bottom use their **_maul_** to attack any creature that falls into the ravine, then drag them away in the hopes of an easy meal. A creature that clings to the cragged edge at the bottom of the ravine has half cover from creatures atop the ravine.
>
>Once a player falls into the ravine, the rest of the pack flees into the woods, then descends into the ravine by another path to assist the sixth wolf in pulling its prey away. The pack flees if six of the eight wolves are killed.

>^FightAgainstTheWolves

As the players depart this area, a player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 13 or greater notices two wolves, slightly larger than the others, watching them from atop an eastern mountain crag that rises above the tree line. A player who succeeds on a DC 20 Wisdom (Insight) check discerns that the wolves appear to be surveying them with a patient intelligence unusual for a wolf. The wolves turn and vanish from sight if noticed or interacted with.

> [!tip]- The Watching Wolves
> 
> The two wolves are **werewolves** in wolf form. Bloodthirsty brutes loyal to [[Kiril Stoyanovich]] and [[Strahd von Zarovich]], they will reappear to stalk the players in [C11. The Werewolves' Hunt](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+I+-+Into+the+Mists/Arc+C+-+Into+the+Valley#C11.%20The%20Werewolves'%20Hunt).

## C7b. Tser Falls
---
> [!cutscene] When the players reach Tser Falls, read:
> You follow the dirt road as it clings to the side of a mountain and ends before an arching bridge of mold-encrusted stone that spans a natural chasm. Gargoyles cloaked in black moss perch on the corners of the bridge, their frowns weatherworn. On the mountainous side of the bridge, a waterfall spills into a misty pool nearly a thousand feet below. The pool feeds a river that meanders into the fog-shrouded pines that blanket the valley.

The chasm's walls are slippery and sheer, and can't be scaled without the aid of magic or a climber's kit.

The bridge is slick with moisture but safe to cross. The road south of the bridge leads down the mountainside to the [[#C2. River Ivlis Crossroads (F)]]; the road north cuts through the mountains to [[#C8. Black Carriage]].

The gargoyles on the bridge are harmless sculptures.

Additionally, when the players arrive, they can see a [[Random Encounters#Revenant|revenant]] standing alone at the midpoint of the bridge with its hands resting on the pommel of its sword, the blade of which is planted firmly on the ground.

> [!handout]- "Bridge Revenant" by Caleb Cleveland
> ![[Bridge Revenant by Caleb Cleveland.png]]

> [!tip]- Vladimir's Fury
> This nameless **revenant** was banished, along with a dozen of its peers, from the ruins of [[Argynvostholt]] shortly after the failure of [[Doru]]’s rebellion three months ago.
> 
> When news of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s planned counterstroke reached them, the knights of [[the Order of the Silver Dragon]] raised their voices, begging [[Sir Vladimir Horngaard|Vladimir Horngaard]] to allow them to lend their swords to the cause.
> 
> [[Sir Vladimir Horngaard|Vladimir]] denied them and, when the knights grew enraged and unruly, banished them from the manor and forbade them from raising their swords against [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] or any of his creatures. Now, only [[Sir Godfrey Gwilym]], [[Sir Vladimir Horngaard|Vladimir Horngaard]], and the spirits of the **phantom warriors** that once fought for [[The Order of the Silver Dragon|the Order]] remain in [[Argynvostholt]].

If the players call out to this nameless **revenant** or step onto the bridge, it hails them in a raspy voice and asks their business. Upon hearing their response, it says, "Old things are stirring and the lord of Castle Ravenloft roams the valley. Tell me: Do you serve him?"

If the players claim to serve [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], the revenant visibly stiffens, but stands aside, saying coldly, "Then be gone on your way, and may your foul work bring you ruin and despair."

If the players deny serving [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], the revenant is visibly relieved and invites them to approach so that it may "get a closer look at them." It introduces itself as a knight of [[the Order of the Silver Dragon]], but claims to have long forgotten its name in life.

If the players' weapons are clearly visible, it asks the players if they oppose the lord of [[Castle Ravenloft]]. If the players claim to oppose [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], the revenant advises them to travel to [[Argynvostholt]] to the west, where [[Sir Godfrey Gwilym]] awaits those who would raise their swords against the darkness that lurks in [[Castle Ravenloft|the castle]]'s depths.

If the players inquire about [[the Order of the Silver Dragon]], the revenant shares only that the knights of [[The Order of the Silver Dragon|the Order]] opposed [[Strahd von Zarovich|the lord of Ravenloft]] in life and suggests that the players speak with [[Sir Godfrey Gwilym|Sir Godfrey]] to obtain further information. If the players obtained [[#^BrokenSilverDragonPendant|the silver pendant]] in the watchtower by the [[#C2. River Ivlis Crossroads (F)]], the revenant recognizes it, but refuses to comment further on its significance.

If the players ask the revenant why it is guarding the bridge, it says only, "Because I raised my voice against my commander and was banished. Now, I stand like my brothers- and sisters-in-arms, watching the dark places of this land and awaiting an order that will never come."

If the players ask why it cannot take up arms against [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] itself, it says only, "Because my commander forbids it, and my spirit is bound from disobeying his will." It is willing to share that its commander's name is [[Sir Vladimir Horngaard]], but is unwilling to share more, advising the players to speak with [[Sir Godfrey Gwilym|Sir Godfrey]] instead.

> [!example]- Secrets of Amber
> If the players ask the revenant about the "amber doors" mentioned in [[Madam Eva]]'s [[#C4f. The Tarokka Reading|Tarokka reading]], it stiffens, then warns the players that they "meddle with things that ought not be meddled with." If the players reassure the [[Random Encounters#Revenant|revenant]] that their interest in the "amber doors" is directed at [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s defeat, the revenant hesitates, then informs them it is "bound never to reveal the secrets of that which we once guarded," but shares that [[Sir Godfrey Gwilym|Sir Godfrey]] can provide the information they seek.

> [!info]- The Oathbound Revenant
> Each [[Random Encounters#Revenant|revenant]] of [[the Order of the Silver Dragon]] has been bound by the effects of [[Sir Vladimir Horngaard|Vladimir Horngaard]]'s **_oathbind_** feature, which binds them to obey [[Sir Vladimir Horngaard|Vladimir]]'s express commands. The revenants of the Order, excepting [[Sir Godfrey Gwilym]], have been given the following commands:
> 
>- Do not betray the secrets of [[the Order of the Silver Dragon]].
>- Raise no weapon against the vampire [[Strahd von Zarovich]], his servants, or his creatures.
>- Do not return to [[Argynvostholt]].
>  
>  A revenant that violates one of these commands suffers the effects of a _geas_ spell and is restrained until the start of its next turn by spiked black wires. (This effect can trigger any number of times each day. Because the revenants are bound by the oaths they swore to [[Sir Vladimir Horngaard|Vladimir]] in life, this effect can't be dispelled.)

If the players ask for directions to [[Argynvostholt]], the revenant advises them to travel "west, beyond the walled town, then south upon the ash-gray path."

If the players mention [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s carriage, the revenant notes its disgust for "the beast von Zarovich" and advises the players to be cautious of him and his servants and spies. If the players mention the [[#C5. The Skeletal Rider|skeletal rider]], the revenant shares that "the Wandering One seeks a road to freedom through the mists. It will never succeed."

Before the players depart, the revenant warns them to beware "those who walk in the skins of wolves," who haunt the forests to the west. "Once, they did not trouble those who travelled the roads," it rasps. "Something has changed, however, and now, their hunger for human flesh cannot be sated." (The revenant doesn't know where to find the werewolves' den, or any further information about the pack.)

The revenant will not leave its post on the bridge under any circumstances.
# C8. Black Carriage

The journey from [[#C4. Tser Pool (G)|Tser Falls]] to the [[#C8. Black Carriage|Black Carriage]] is one-and-a-half miles and takes thirty minutes.

> [!cutscene] As the players make this journey, read:
> You continue down the winding road, which climbs a short distance north before bending west to avoid a bald-headed peak on the right, its craggy cliffs bearing an array of sharp rocks that jut out over the roadway.
> 
> It's not long before the road bends north once again, a second hill arising from the fog on your left. Twisted trees dot its steep slopes, their branches reaching out like gnarled fingers.
> 
> As you travel deeper between the hills, the road narrows and the cliffs grow taller. Soon, though, the hills fall away once more, the road continuing forth into a small, fog-choked basin.
>  
> Even here, in the mountains, the forest and the fog are inescapable. Ahead, the dirt road splits in two, widening toward the east. There you see patches of cobblestone, suggesting that the eastern branch was once an important thoroughfare.

[[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s carriage is not present, though the players can see deep grooves in the muddy road that pass from the [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia#B1. Old Svalich Road (A)|Old Svalich Road]] onto the old cobblestone-strewn thoroughfare that leads to [[Castle Ravenloft]].

The journey from the [[#C8. Black Carriage]] to the western **Gates of Barovia** is a quarter-mile and takes five minutes. This area is as described in Gates of Barovia (p. 33), but seen from the opposite side.

> [!INFO]- The Western Gates of Barovia
> This is a replica of the Eastern gates of Barovia, except the characters approach it from the opposite side. Describe this gate differently, using your own DM style to fill in the gap, however should you need a reminder of savoir in the moment, see below the original description.
>
>> [!cutscene] When the players approach, read:
> > The fog spills out of the forest to swallow up the road behind you. Ahead, jutting from the impenetrable woods on both sides of the road, are high stone buttresses looming gray in the fog. Huge iron gates hang on the stonework. Dew clings with cold tenacity to the rusted bars. Two headless statues of armed guardians flank the gate, their heads now lying among the weeds at their feet. They greet you only with silence.
> 
> If the characters are traveling on foot, the gates swing open as they approach, screeching as the hinges move. The gates close behind the characters after they pass through.

> [!Example]- Visiting Castle Ravenloft
> 
> If the players decide to visit [[Castle Ravenloft]] (e.g., to investigate [[Gertruda]]'s disappearance), the journey from the crossroads is two-and-one-half miles long and takes fifty minutes. When the players arrive, the exterior of the castle is as described in [[Arc P - Ravenloft Heist]].
# C9. Old Bonegrinder

The journey from the Gates of Barovia to [[#C9. Old Bonegrinder]] is two-and-a-half miles long and takes forty-five minutes.

> [!cutscene] As the players make this journey, read:
> 
> The road continues forward, passing between a patch of dark woods. The air here is as quiet as the grave, the trees standing perfectly still in the unnerving silence.
> 
> Not far from the road, nestled in the overgrown underbrush, stands a mossy stone slab standing just under six feet in height. It rests on an old, cracked stone circle, and seems to bear some kind of carving.

Briefly pause to allow the players to act or react. If the players choose to investigate the slab, they find that it bears a crude carving of a raven over an engraved three-pointed star, the grooves lined with lichen and moss. (The slab is an ancient monument to the [[The Ladies of the Fanes#The Seeker|The Seeker]], and the three-pointed star the symbol of [[The Faith of the Ladies Three|the Ladies Three]].)

> [!cutscene] If the players remain silent or continue ahead, read:
> 
> The road soon emerges from the woods once more, veering between two hills. Before long, it bends to the north, hugging the base of a mountain.

The players emerge at the base of the hill upon which [[#C9. Old Bonegrinder]] rests. There are no ravens at or near the windmill.

The windmill's stone walls are easily climbed. Wooden floors separate the various levels. There are no lights within, since the hags have darkvision.

> [!cutscene] As the players approach, read:
> The Old Svalich Road transitions here from being a winding path through the Balinok Mountains to a lazy trail that hugs the mountainside as it descends into a fog-filled valley. In the heart of the valley you see a walled town near the shores of a great mountain lake, its waters dark and still. A branch in the road leads west to a promontory, atop which is perched a dilapidated stone windmill, its warped wooden vanes stripped bare.

Closer investigation of the windmill yields a few more details.

> [!cutscene] When the players look closer, read:
> The onion-domed edifice leans forward and to one side, as though trying to turn away from the stormy gray sky. You see gray brick walls and dirt-covered windows on the upper floors. A decrepit wooden platform encircles the windmill above a flimsy doorway leading to the building's interior.

Beyond the windmill is the forest. Once atop the windmill's hill, the characters can see a ring of four squat megaliths at the forest's edge. Ravens can be seen circling in the air above the stones.

As the windmill comes into view, the players also notice [[Morgantha, Dream Peddler|Morgantha]] approaching from the opposite direction with her cart.

> [!cutscene] As Morgantha approaches, read:
> You hear the sound of small, wooden wheels rolling across damp cobbles. You trace the lonely sound to a hunched figure bundled in rags, pushing a rickety wooden cart through the fog.

This scene largely unfolds as described in Dream Pastries (p. 48), but [[Morgantha, Dream Peddler|Morgantha]] is coming from the town of [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], not [[the village of Barovia]], and she doesn't have a child stuffed into a sack in her peddler's cart.

> [!handout]- "Morgantha, Disguised" by Calev Cleveland
> ![[Morgantha Disguised by Caleb Cleveland.png]]

[[Morgantha, Dream Peddler|Morgantha]], a [night hag](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#night%20hag_mm) in the guise of an old woman, has returned to [[#C9. Old Bonegrinder]] from the outskirts of [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] after trying to sell her dream pastries for 1 gp apiece to the [[Barovian Refugees]] there. She'd go from tent to tent, requesting audience. Most of the time, no one answers. When someone does, [[Morgantha, Dream Peddler|Morgantha]] tries to peddle her wares, offering customers an escape from the misery and despair of everyday Barovian life.

[[Morgantha, Dream Peddler|Morgantha]] greets the players warmly, calling them "weary travellers," and shares her hope that the road has not been too hard on them. She freely shares the following information if asked:

- She is a peddler who sells baked wares to the "good people of Barovia."
- She is just returning from a day peddling her goods to the townsfolk of [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] and the "poor, hungry dears" camped outside the gates. (Her latter comment is referring to a camp of [[Barovian refugees]] that has not been allowed to enter the town.)
- She lives in the old windmill up the hill with her two daughters, [[Bella]] and [[Offalia]]. (She kindly declines to share what happened to her "husband," saying only, "Now, that's an old woman's business, meant to be shared only if she chooses.")

[[Morgantha, Dream Peddler|Morgantha]] has a few "dream pastries" left from her workday—"filled with the light and love of dreaming"—which she offers to the players for free as a "first sample." She advises the players that the dream pastries taste best after a warm meal, "especially with a nice bit of wine to wash them down." The dream pastries, if eaten, affect the players as described in **Dream Pastries** below.

> [!info]- Dream Pastries and their effects
> These pastries look and taste like small mincemeat pies. A creature that eats one in its entirety must succeed on a DC 16 Constitution saving throw or fall into a trance that lasts for 1d4 + 4 hours, during which time the creature is [incapacitated](https://2014.5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#incapacitated_phb) and has a speed of 0 feet. The trance ends if the affected creature takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.
> 
> While in the trance, the creature dreams of being in some joyous place, far removed from the evils of the world. The places and characters in the dream are vivid and believable, and when the dream ends, the affected creature experiences a longing to return to the place.

If asked how she manages to travel the roads safely, [[Morgantha, Dream Peddler|Morgantha]] only smiles and promises the players that "an old woman has her tricks." ("But," she complains, "my back and poor feet do complain from time to time. I can't wait to soak them in a tub of nice, hot water once I'm home.")

If the players ask to enter her home, [[Morgantha, Dream Peddler|Morgantha]] apologizes for her lack of hospitality, but notes that she's tired and not prepared for visitors, besides. (The players are welcome, she says, to visit another day if they'd like.)

When the conversation runs out of steam, [[Morgantha, Dream Peddler|Morgantha]] bids the players a safe journey, and lets them know that they can find her outside of [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]'s gates in the future, should they like to purchase additional pastries.

Before she departs, [[Morgantha, Dream Peddler|Morgantha]] warns the players that the guards at the [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] gates are confiscating silver coins and visible silver items from travellers as a tax. "But," she says, tapping her nose with a cheeky, half-toothed grin, "you didn't hear it from me."

> [!example]- Morgantha Detected
> If a player discerns [[Morgantha, Dream Peddler|Morgantha]]'s fiendish nature, such as by using a paladin's **_divine sense_**, and confronts her about it, she pauses, then congratulates them on their perceptiveness. She then smiles sweetly and notes she is breaking no laws, asking: "Is it a crime to be as one was made?" If the player insisted on attacking her, she adds: "And does such a crime demand immediate execution?"
> 
> If the players insist that it does, she immediately kneels, pleading sarcastically for mercy and an opportunity to repent. "Allow me to return to my home and reflect upon my sins," she adds, grinning. If attacked, she vanishes using her **_etherealness_** feature, cackling.
> 
> If the players approach the windmill, she notifies [[Bella]] and [[Offalia]], who join her in the Ethereal Plane. If the players attempt to damage or destroy the windmill, the hags then return to the Material Plane and warn them to stop on pain of death. See Morgantha Gets Suspicious for more information on conflict with the hags. (The windmill currently doesn't contain any children, and won't until [[Arc H - The Lost Soul]] begins.)
# C10. The Deep Woods

The journey from Old Bonegrinder to the **Town of Vallaki** is five-and-three-quarter miles long and takes two hours.

> [!cutscene] As the players make this journey, read:
> 
> The winding valley road hugs the mountainside as it meanders north. The dark woods cling to the opposite side of the road, the tall, gnarled trees creeping as close as they dare. You can hear the sound of the wind rustling through the leaves and the occasional creak of branches. From time to time, it almost sounds like the trees are whispering among themselves, or stirring their ancient roots in the old, rotten mulch.
> 
> As the road continues, the forest swallows it up on both sides. The trees towering far above your heads, blocking out all but the barest hints of gray light. The air grows thick and heavy with the scent of moss and rotting leaves; in the distance, you hear a raven's gurgling croak, followed by the sound of fluttering wings.
> 
> Before long, it becomes clear that your presence in this dreary land has not gone unnoticed. A raven follows you for several minutes while keeping a respectful distance.

> [!cutscene] If they leave it alone, read:
> 
> More ravens begin to take an interest in you. Before long, their numbers swell, and soon hundreds of them are watching you.

This encounter unfolds as described in [[Random Encounters#Swarms of Ravens|Swarms of Ravens]], with the party joined by two **swarms of ravens**. If she is with the party and able to fly, the disguised [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]] takes wing alongside the flock, but keeps a sharp eye on the players as they travel.

> [!cutscene] As the players proceed down the road, read:
> 
> Ahead, the trees to the north break, revealing a grassy field. The tall grasses sway in the chill air, the field stretching until it reaches the shores of a dark, distant lake. Fog clings to the shoreline. Even from a distance, you can hear the faint sound of water lapping against the rocks.

If [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is with the party, she freezes and asks the players if the party can take a quick detour across the field to the lake. If asked, she notes only that the lake seems strangely familiar.

Lake Zarovich is as described in L. Lake Zarovich (p. 38), but without the beached rowboats or Bluto's boat visible.

> [!cutscene] As the lake comes into proper view, read:
> At the foot of a mountain, nestled in the misty forest, is a large lake. The water is perfectly still and dark, reflecting the black clouds overhead like a monstrous mirror.

Upon arriving at the shore of the lake, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] notes with trepidation that it appears to be the same lake that she has seen in her dreams. (If she hasn't already shared it, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] tells the story of her dream, described in [[#Ireena's Tale|C4d. The Dancing Fire]] above.)

[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is certain, however, that she has never visited this lake with [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and her father, [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]]. She is uncertain of the implications, but becomes lost in thought if a player reminds her that her father found her wandering the [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia#B1. Old Svalich Road (A)|Old Svalich Woods]] as a child.
# C11. The Werewolves' Hunt

> [!cutscene] As the players continue down the road, read:
> 
> As quickly as it appeared, the field is swallowed up by the forest again, the trees closing in around you once more. The dark undergrowth rustles and stirs in the wind, and the weight of the forest presses in from all sides. You're unable to shake the sense that, somehow, you're being watched.

If one of the players has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher, or if one of the players makes a successful DC 14 Wisdom (Perception) check, the notice the below.

> [!cutscene] Read:
> A humanoid shadow flickers in the distance—then vanishes from sight.

The shadow belongs to a **werewolf**. Its companions—three **wolves** and an additional **werewolf**—lurk in the woods nearby.

The werewolves don't attack immediately, preferring to wait for the perfect time to strike.

> [!cutscene] If the players continue down the road, read:
> 
> The woodland road takes you through a small, forested clearing, the circular treeline littered with dense thickets, moss-covered boulders, and craggy ridges.
> 
> Then, without warning, five wolves leap from the forest, yellow eyes glinting as their muzzles curl into snarls!

> [!combat]- Fight against the Werewolves
> Have the players, **wolves**, **werewolves** (in wolf form), and (if they are with the party) [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], the two **swarms of ravens**, and [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]] (a **wereraven** in raven form) roll initiative. Any character with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score lower than 14 is surprised.
> 
> Modify the wolves' statblocks as described in [[#C7a. The Ravine]]. In addition, use the **Barovian werewolf** statblock below for the werewolves, rather than the one in the _Monster Manual_:

> 
> In combat, the **wolves** work together, using their **_Claws_** to knock characters prone, then using their **_Maul_** to grapple prone targets. Once the wolves have dragged a grappled character away from the party, the **werewolves** shift their attention to target them with its **_bite_**. The first character targeted in this way notices that the werewolves are slightly larger than the other three and have intelligent, disturbingly human eyes.
>

> 
> A werewolf flees if it begins its turn with 20 hit points or fewer and doesn’t regenerate, or if it begins its turn with 0 hit points on three turns in a row. Any surviving wolves follow soon after.
> 
> If the werewolves die, they reverts to their true forms: a young man with pale, freckled skin and a lean, muscled frame, and a brawny young man with a cruel face and dark, oily hair. Each bears a bloody, raw, and blighted wound on his side—the source of the their lycanthropic affliction.

Any players who failed their saving throw against the curse of lycanthropy soon find that, although they regain hit points normally, the original wound remains cosmetically bloody and raw—just as described in [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]]'s manuscript on the werewolf's curse. The next full moon takes place on the night of the sixth day after the players’ arrival in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]].

> [!info]- Lycanthropy in Barovia
> In Barovia, the curse of lycanthropy spreads as described in **Player Characters as Lycanthropes** (Monster Manual, p. 207). This can be seen below
> 
> A non-lycanthrope humanoid hit by an attack that carries the curse of lycanthropy must succeed on a Constitution saving throw (DC 8 + the lycanthrope's proficiency bonus + the lycanthrope's Constitution modifier) or be cursed. If the character embraces the curse (see below,) his or her alignment becomes the one defined for the lycanthrope. The DM is free to decide that a change in alignment places the character under DM control until the curse of lycanthropy is removed.
> 
> However, an infected player or other creature does not automatically receive any changes to their ability scores or Armor Class, nor do they automatically receive the benefits of the lycanthrope's stat block (e.g., immunities or regeneration).
> 
> Instead, an infected creature only receives the benefits of lycanthropy upon transforming into their hybrid form on the night of the full moon. During this time, the creature becomes an NPC under the DM's control until dawn, at which point the creature loses the benefits of lycanthropy.
> 
> An infected creature can embrace the curse of lycanthropy—and so gain its full benefits—by completing a certain task, depending on the nature of their curse:
> 
> - An infected **werewolf** must voluntarily kill an innocent humanoid, without fear or hatred, and devour their flesh.
> - An infected **wereraven** must be knocked unconscious while voluntarily attempting to protect another humanoid from (what they believe to be) near-certain death.
> 
> An infected lycanthrope can be recognized by the scar of the wound that originally transmitted the curse. The wound will never entirely heal, and remains raw and bloody until the curse is lifted.
> 
> The child of two lycanthropes possesses the full benefits of lycanthropy from birth, and may learn to control their curse as they age. A child born with lycanthropy in this way cannot be cured except by means of a _wish_ spell.
> 
> Finally, while the mists remain, the lunar cycle is accelerated in Barovia: the full moon arrives once every two weeks, instead of once every four. **The first full moon that the players experience takes place on Neyavr 8th—the sixth night after they first arrive in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]].**

> [!example]- Curing Player Lycanthropy
> 
> The players can learn from the Martikovs of the Blue Water Inn, [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten]], or [[Kasimir Velikov]] of the Vallakian [[Vistani]] encampment that the next full moon will take place on their sixth night after first entering [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]. As the night of the full moon approaches, players infected with lycanthropy experience nightmares of increasing severity, as well as an increasing appetite for raw meat.
> 
> Players infected with **werewolf** lycanthropy will be able to search for a cure in [[Arc I - The Walls of Krezk]] after meeting [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten]] in [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana]]. Players of an appropriate class can also cure themselves and others of lycanthropy by casting _remove curse_ upon reaching 5th level. ([[Father Lucian Petrovich]] of St. Andral's Church in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] cannot cast the spell and therefore cannot cure lycanthropy.)

> [!warning]- Embracing Werewolf Lycanthropy
> As noted in [[Getting Started#Campaign Contract|the Campaign Contract]], this campaign is designed for heroic player characters, rather than villainous ones. As such, it is incompatible with characters who choose to embrace **werewolf** lycanthropy by killing and devouring an innocent humanoid. If a player expresses any interest in doing so, warn them that embracing the curse will result in their current character being turned into a villainous NPC, requiring them to create a new character instead.

# C12. The Town of Vallaki
## C12a. The Vallakian Gates
---
The road continues forward to [[The Town of Vallaki]], largely as described in Approaching the Town (p. 95).

> [!cutscene] When the players approach, read:
> The woods recede, revealing a sullen mountain burg surrounded by a wooden palisade. Thick fog presses up against this wall, as though looking for a way inside, hoping to catch the town aslumber. More than a dozen ramshackle tents have been set up against the palisade wall. Among them, dozens of ragged, emaciated people mill about or sit by low-burning campfires and bedrolls, their hollow gazes watching silently as you approach.
> 
> The dirt road ends at a set of sturdy iron gates with a pair of shadowy figures standing behind them. Planted in the ground and flanking the road outside the gates are a half-dozen pikes with wolves' heads impaled on them.

If the players departed from [[#C4. Tser Pool (G)]] that morning, they arrive in [[#C12. The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] at dusk.

> [!cutscene] If [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is visibly traveling with the party, add:
> 
> Some of the folks in the tents clung to the walls regard [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] with dull recognition, but none lift a hand in greeting or make any gesture of warmth.

This area, the Morning Gate (or, as some locals like to call it, the Mourning Gate), is largely as described in Town Gates (p. 95). A tall gate made of iron bars leading into town.

Heavy iron chains with iron padlocks keep the gates shut at night. During the day, the gates are closed but not typically locked.

The tents are a camp of [[Barovian Refugees]], housing those who survived the trek from [[the village of Barovia]] in the wake of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s siege.
### The Refugee Camp 

If she is with the party, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is heartbroken and enraged at the sight of the refugee camp. She suggests that she meet with the refugees while the players find lodging in town, and promises to join the players later. The players can dissuade her with a successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check. Otherwise, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] approaches one of the cookfires, either alone or—if the players have insisted on joining her—with company.

The members of the refugee camp, which include [[Emeric]], a melancholy older man, and [[Magda]], a grief-stricken young woman, can share the following information:

- The [[Barovian Refugees]] arrived at [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]'s gates a few weeks ago, but were barred from entering. When they attempted to breach the gates by force, the guards summoned a man they called [[Izek Strazni|Izek]], who bore a twisted devil's arm and conjured fire to drive the [[Barovian Refugees]] back.
- Since then, the [[Barovian Refugees|refugees]] have set up camp outside the town's walls, clustering together for protection and warmth. They've managed to secure some minor necessities, such as the tents, by bribing the guards at the gates, but have been unable to persuade the guards to allow them entry or to even invite the town's [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] to discuss their plight.
- Swarms of bats and packs of wolves have plagued the camp each night since they've arrived. Thankfully, no one has died yet, but several refugees have been wounded.
- Due to losses they suffered on the road and the threat of the [[Strahd von Zarovich|Devil]] in [[Castle Ravenloft]], the refugees are unwilling to risk the journey back home, instead hoping to wait until the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] sees reason and allows them to enter the walls.
- Roughly one-quarter of the [[Barovian Refugees|refugees]] have become addicted to "dream pastries," a foodstuff sold by the peddler [[Morgantha, Dream Peddler|Morgantha]]. These [[Barovian Refugees|refugees]] seek an escape from the misery and despair of their situation. Those who eat a dream pastry fall into a trance as described above.

The [[Barovian Refugees]] are lost in despair. Some recall a [[Barovians#Beliefs and Superstitions|superstition]] that red-haired Barovian women bring misfortune, and suggest that [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] herself has brought a curse upon their people. Few have any wish to deal with her further.

Following her interaction with the [[Barovian Refugees|refugees]], [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is enraged by the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]]'s callousness, and vows to make her best efforts to secure entry for the [[Barovian Refugees]] into [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]].
### The Guards at the Gates

The guards at the gates largely act as described in Town Gates (p. 95). One has a silvered spear, while the other has a quiver containing a dozen crossbow bolts, half of which are silvered.

The guards greet all visitors with suspicion, particularly those who arrive at night. If the characters arrive at night, one or more of them must succeed on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check to convince the guards to unlock the gate and let them enter.

If trouble breaks out at one of the gates, the guards there cry out, "To arms!" Their shouts are echoed across [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], putting the entire town on alert within minutes. [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] has twenty-four human [guards](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#guard_mm), half of whom are on duty at any given time (six stand watch at the gates, six patrol the walls). The town can also muster a militia of fifty able-bodied human [commoners](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#commoner_mm) armed with clubs, daggers, and torches.

The guards demand that each person first identify themselves. Once identified, each player must show their teeth ("To prove you're not vampires.") and briefly be exposed to a necklace strung with bulbs of garlic ("To prove you're not werewolves"). (The [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich]] has, incorrectly, informed his guards that werewolves are severely allergic to garlic.)

The guards then demand each player pay 1 gold piece as a toll in order to enter the village. The guards refuse to accept payment on behalf of the [[Barovian Refugees|refugees]], whom the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] has specifically barred from entering, claiming concerns of "sickness, unruliness, and malicious unhappiness."

If the players pay the toll, the guards also insist that each entrant opens their purse (or equivalent) and surrender any silver pieces in their possession. (If the players complain, the guards assure them that the silver is needed to produce the silvered weapons necessary to defend the town from werewolves.) In exchange for any silver coins that they give up, the players receive an amount of copper coins of equal value—minus a ten percent tax.

If asked about lodging, the guards can share information about the Blue Water Inn, which offers food, wine, and shelter to visitors. They also inform them that a stranger with pointed ears is staying there. He came to Barovia from a distant land, riding into town on a carnival wagon. "You won't find much sympathy for your plight from the Good Vallakians, but perhaps a fellow stranger would be welcome company for yourselves."
The guards are also willing to provide additional directions to other landmarks in the town in exchange for a bribe of 1 gold piece.

Each time the players pass through the gates, including the first, the guards nod at them and intone the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]]'s favored phrase: "All will be well."

> [!example]- Gertruda's Fate
> If the players inquire about [[Gertruda]]'s fate and provide a description, the guards truthfully share that they haven't seen anyone resembling her.

### Entering the Town

> [!cutscene] As the players pass down Vallaki's main avenue, read:
> 
> You pass from the earthen road onto cobblestone streets, mud staining your boots and the bottoms of your trousers. Behind you, the gates close with a slam, and you can see the guards resume their posts behind it. In the distance, you can see two other figures bearing pikes, patrolling the walls as they look down on the twisted forest beyond.
> 
> The eaves of the buildings hang with old banners and tattered fabrics that flap and twist in the chill breeze. The banners are painted with faded words and illustrations, but time has robbed them of both their legibility and any beauty they may have once had.
> 
> Flickering candlelight lingers behind the shuttered townhouse windows, and humanoid shadows move beyond closed curtains. Long shadows lurk in the alleyways, where the grass grows long and twisted beneath the stained and sagging wood of the buildings above.
> 
> The streets are empty, though you can see a single cloaked figure traveling away from you down the central road. In the distance beyond the walls, a lone wolf howls, and a cold gust of wind cuts through the night like a knife.

The cloaked figure is [[Willemina Rikalova]], as described in St. Andral's Church (p. 97). She is traveling to the church to pray for the freedom of her son, [[Udo Lukovich]].

As the characters pass through the streets, they are noticed by [[Ernst Larnak]], who intently watches them—though doesn't follow them—as described in Lady Wachter's Wish (p. 124).

Characters who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14 or higher notice him doing so. If they confront him, he claims that he keeps a watchful eye on all strangers, though he doesn't mention the name of his employer. If the characters threaten him, he backs off and reports to [[Lady Wachter]] after he believes he's not being watched or pursued.

[[Ernst Larnak]] does not yet deliver an invitation to dine with [[Lady Wachter]], though he does return to N4. Wachterhaus (p. 110) to report back to Lady Wachter when the players leave his sight.
## C12b. The Blue Water Inn
---
This area is largely as described in N2. Blue Water Inn (p. 98).

> [!cutscene] As the players approach the Inn, read:
> Gray smoke issues from the chimney of this large, two-story wooden building with a stone foundation and sagging tile roof, upon which several ravens have perched. A painted wooden sign hanging above the main entrance depicts a blue waterfall.

[[#C12b. The Blue Water Inn|The Blue Water Inn]] is [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]'s main gathering place for locals, especially at night. The innkeeper, [[Urwin Martikov]], considers the inn a sanctuary from the evils of this land. In the event of trouble, the windows and doors can all be barred shut from within.

A bed for the night costs 1 ep. Characters looking for something to eat are fed hot beet soup and fresh bread at no additional charge. A cooked wolf steak costs 1 ep.

The inn offers a pint of Purple Grapemash No. 3 wine for 3 cp, or a pint of the superior Red Dragon Crush wine for 1 sp. [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] is hurt if the characters complain about the wines, for his family makes them.

If [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]] is present, she bids the players farewell with a soft, sentimental trill, then departs to join the other ravens resting atop the roof. (If the players later return to the inn to look for her, she is not present.)

When the players first arrive, the inn contains the following notable NPCs:

- [[Danika Dorakova]], who is pouring drinks and serving patrons in **N2c. Taproom**;
- [[Urwin Martikov]], who is cooking bread and beet stew in **N2e. Kitchen**;
- [[Brom Martikov|Brom]] and [[Bray Martikov]], who are playing with toys in **N20. Boys' Bedroom**; and
- [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]], who is telling stories to the patrons in **N2c. Taproom**, including [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]] and [[Karl Wachter]].

> ![[The Martikovs of the Blue Water Inn by Caleb Cleveland.png]]

### Entering the Inn

> [!cutscene] When the players enter, read:
> Damp cloaks hang from pegs in the entrance portico. The tavern is packed with tables and chairs, with narrow paths meandering between them. A bar stretches along one wall, under a balcony that can be reached by a wooden staircase that hugs the north wall. Another balcony overhangs an entrance to the east. All the windows are fitted with thick shutters and crossbars. Lanterns hanging above the bar and resting on the tables bathe the room in dull orange light and cast shadows upon the walls, most of which are adorned with wolf heads mounted on wooden plaques.
> 
> Nearly a dozen Vallakians sit scattered across the various tables, nursing mugs of wine or bowls of hearty stew. Along the staircase, a colorfully dressed man wearing a feathered, wide-brimmed hat gestures wildly at the head of a long table, holding the rapt attention of the several patrons sitting there. You hear a wave of laughter ripple through the group, followed by a smattering of light applause.

The man is the ringmaster [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]], the lone guest of the Blue Water Inn at present.  They're a colourfully dressed half-elf bard who goes by the name [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]]—a false identity adopted by the legendary vampire hunter [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rudolph van Richten]]. He regales tavern patrons with stories so outrageous as to be hardly believable, yet he asserts they are true indeed. [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] claims to be a carnival ringmaster from a distant land. He arrived at the inn on the same morning that the players arrived in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], taking advantage of [[Urwin Martikov]]'s generosity and good nature. When he arrived, he was accompanied by a monkey named [[Piccolo]]. The monkey wasn't welcome at the inn, so [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] gave it to the local toymaker.

[[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] admits to having no musical talent but manages to entertain locals nonetheless with his stories of faraway places. Twice each day, at dawn and again at dusk, he leaves the inn with a couple of apples and a cooked wolf steak wrapped in a handkerchief. He claims the food is for his portly friend, "the destitute toymaker" and his pet monkey. In fact, the apples are for his horse Drusilla, and the steak is for the captured [[Arabelle]].

During his stay at the inn, [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] is quietly gathering information on the [[Keepers of the Feather]], trying to figure out the identities of all the wereravens in town. He's also trying to learn as much as he can about the [[Vistani]], particularly the ones living in the camp just outside town. He carries an iron key that unlocks the door to his carnival wagon.

> [!handout]- "Rictavio" by Caleb Cleveland
> ![[Rictavio by Caleb Cleveland.png]]

Two of the five listeners at his table are [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]] and [[Karl Wachter]], who are brothers of noble birth. They are brash drunkards always looking for trouble, though they are smart enough not to pick fights with well-armed strangers. Their mother, [[Lady Fiona Wachter]], is an influential figure in town, but her sons never talk about her. They'd rather listen to tales of the characters' harrowing adventures or hear about how the characters plan to free [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] from the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|burgomaster]]'s madness.

When the players first enter the inn, [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]], who is waiting tables, greets them and asks them to wait at the bar while she tends to other patrons.

If the characters approach the bar, [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] exits the kitchen carrying a tray of fresh-baked bread, hot beet stew, and wolf steaks, which he sets down on the bar. (The food smells mouth-wateringly delicious.)

[[Szoldar Szoldarovich]] and [[Yevgeni Krushkin]] are also seated at the bar. They are local hunters who frequent the [[#C12b. The Blue Water Inn|Blue Water Inn]]. They kill wolves and sell the meat for a living, and their work is dangerous and bloody. Both men are grim and have haunted looks in their eyes.

These two are dour fellows, but they seldom pass up an opportunity to earn coin. If the characters are looking for guides or information about the land of Barovia, [[Szoldar Szoldarovich|Szoldar]] and [[Yevgeni Krushkin|Yevgeni]] can be of service. They aren't afraid to venture beyond [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]'s walls during the day, and they know the woods and valley well. They're willing to serve as guides for 5 gp per day, or to provide directions to important landmarks in exchange for free drinks. They think it's foolish to travel "this cursed realm" at night and won't do so unless their payment is exorbitant (100 gp or more).

On rare occasions when he has something to say, [[Szoldar Szoldarovich|Szoldar]] speaks brusquely, while [[Yevgeni Krushkin|Yevgeni]] usually parrots his friend in not so many words. [[Szoldar Szoldarovich|Szoldar]] has a notch in his bow for every wolf he's killed, while [[Yevgeni Krushkin|Yevgeni]] adds a new swatch to his wolfskin cloak every time he makes a kill. Both men have families but spend most of their time together, either drowning their sorrows or hunting in the woods. Most of the wolf heads that adorn the tavern walls are the result of their handiwork.

[[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] greets the players warmly and welcomes them to [[#C12b. The Blue Water Inn|the Blue Water Inn]]. If the players don't direct the conversation elsewhere, he notes that they look like travellers and asks if they need rooms for the night.

Before [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] can reply to the players, [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] returns and apologizes to the players for her delay. Assuming the players do not interrupt, the conversation then proceeds as follows:

- [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] light-heartedly accuses [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] of plotting to rent rooms to guests "for free" again, an allegation that [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] cheerfully denies.
- [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] tells the players that [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] has already allowed one other guest to stay free and would "bankrupt the inn" with generosity if she weren't there to keep the books. ([[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] graciously concedes the point.)
- "After all," [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] says cheekily, "why else did I marry you?" With a smile, [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] replies, "A rare instance of common sense, I imagine."
- [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] pecks [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]]'s cheek with a kiss and says, "The table by the window is getting hungry." [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] winks at the players, picks up the tray again, and exits the bar to deliver the food.

[[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] then tells the players the rates for room and board, as listed above (1ep per night.)
Both the large guest room, N2m. Guest Room (p. 102), as well as the two small guest rooms, N2l. Guest Rooms (p. 102), are available for rent.

When [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] returns, he offers to take the players' orders for dinner, assuming they're hungry.

The players then have a few minutes to talk with [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] or amongst themselves. During this conversation, [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] can provide the players with information about [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]], the Festival of the Blazing Sun (which will take place in five days at noon), and the nearby [[Vistani]] camp, as described in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] Lore (p. 96).

Both [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] can provide directions to any major landmark inside of [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], including **N1. St. Andral's Church**, **N5. Arasek Stockyard**, and **N8. Town Square**. If the players ask about the inn's other guest, [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] and [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] can also share information about [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]], which is largely as described in N2c. Taproom (p. 100), except that [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] first arrived that same morning.

The inn's most recent shipment of wine is slightly late, but has not been sufficiently delayed as to make [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] alarmed. As such, he does not ask the players to investigate the Wizard of Wines at this point. (This quest will not become available until the players reach level 5. See [[Arc J - The Stolen Gem]] for more information.)

If the players order food or wine in the taproom, [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] offers to seat them at the long table at the south end of the taproom and promises that they'll be served shortly. (See **Map 5.2: Blue Water Inn**.)
### The Ringmaster's Tale

If any of the players approach [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]]'s table, [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]] and [[Karl Wachter]] urge them to have a seat. "He's about to tell a story," [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]] whispers loudly. ([[Szoldar Szoldarovich]], the wolf hunter, has turned his chair away from the bar to listen in.)

> [!cutscene] After clearing his throat, Rictavio shares the following story:
> 
> The vampire Count Belasco kept his coffin, not in a crypt or keep, but in the cellar of an old, decrepit inn, which was managed by his servant, Igoron.
> 
> Poor Count Belasco had a terrible secret: In his ancient age, his scalp was beginning to rot, his hair falling out in great clumps and knots. In embarrassment, he commanded Igoron to purchase a beautiful raven-black wig, hoping to preserve the handsome, younger man he had once been.
> 
> "A handsome man indeed," agreed one of his guests—an elderly, near-blind widow named Olivenka—one particular moonlit night. Dear Olivenka kept to herself, spending her days sorting and re-sorting her late husband's rock collection, which she kept lovingly in her purse. Despite the Count's odd behavior and pale skin, she suspected nothing, her old vision too blurry to make out the fangs that poked down amidst his teeth.
> 
> As always, the Count felt an urge to feed upon her—and though her flattering words quelled his interest, he felt the thirst in his fangs all the same. "Igoron!" he boomed. "Fetch my coat—I'm going hunting."
> 
> "Yes, sire," Igoron wheezed. As he returned, he whimpered, "Best be back before dawn, milord. I'm cleaning the curtains tonight. Want you nice and safe in your coffin before sunrise."
> 
> Count Belasco scoffed. "Fear not, simple Igoron," he boasted. "I know well the hour of my enemy. Not a thing could stir my spirit to linger beneath its dreadful rays."
> 
> And so the Count departed. He lurked in alleyways and prowled across rooftops—yet he found not a single morsel to sate his thirst. It was with surprise, that the hungry, defeated Count finally looked up to the velvet skies and saw the periwinkle-grey of approaching morning.
> 
> With panic, he flew through the streets. Four blocks away. A streak of orange began to slice across the sky. Three blocks. Two—
> 
> —the door to the inn slammed shut behind him.
> 
> "Goodness," Olivenka said, yawning atop the staircase. "Have you been out all night?"
> 
> In an eyeblink, the Count's great silhouette towered far above her. "Yes," he growled. "But I've only just found what I've been looking for. Olivenka—_I want to suck your blood!_"
> 
> Ordinarily, one of Count Belasco's victims would scream, flee, or faint—yet he had made one, terrible mistake.
> 
> He had forgotten that Olivenka's cataract-ridden eyes couldn't quite see his fangs.
> 
> "You disgusting man!" Olivenka screeched, and whirled eighteen years' worth of rare rocks and minerals directly toward his head. There was a terrible thud—and a terrible splintering of wood—and Count Belasco went tumbling down to the floor below. When he opened his eyes, he saw Olivenka staring in horror, not at him, but at his _head_—his _bare_ head.
> 
> There, just beneath the eastern window, lay his beloved wig. He dove for it, claws outstretched—and a sliver of sunlight grazed across his skin.
> 
> There was a sizzle, a hiss, and a burst of smoke and flame. Olivenka, purse clutched to her chest, watched in awe as Count Belasco succumbed to the morning light, until all that remained was a smoldering heap of ash and a charred, smoking wig.

"Poor Olivenka never quite got over it," [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] concludes, his eyes twinkling. "After all—it was quite the 'hair-raising' experience!" As his listeners boo, guffaw, and applaud, he bows, then waves to [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] for another round of drinks. As she approaches, [[Brom Martikov|Brom]] and [[Bray Martikov|Bray]] run past her into the kitchen, giggling.

If spoken with, [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] is willing to share the following information over drinks:

- He is [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]], a half-elf carnival ringmaster having travelled long and far in search of new acts for his circus. He's not entirely sure how he wound up in Barovia, but he's working to make the most of it. (This is a lie. A DC 16 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]]'s words sound a bit too smooth and practiced.)
- He recently arrived that morning, and took up residence in [[#C12b. The Blue Water Inn|the Blue Water Inn]]'s private suite. "The good innkeepers have generously let me stay in exchange for tales and good humour," he notes, smiling.

During the conversation, [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] subtly attempts to learn more information than he reveals, hoping to glean the players' identities, capabilities, relationships, and histories in and beyond Barovia. If asked why he seems to be so curious, he bombastically insists that he's always in search of new tales to add to his repertoire.

When he's finished his drink, [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] takes another flourishing bow and excuses himself. As he does, [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]] and [[Karl Wachter|Karl]] boo and urge [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] to tell another story. "We've heard one about a stupid Count," [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]] says. "What about a stupid Baron?"

If the players don't intervene, the following sequence of events then occurs:

- The table and nearby taproom go silent, with many patrons eyeing [[Nikolai Wachter]] and [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] nervously.
- From his place at the bar, [[Szoldar Szoldarovich|Szoldar]] rumbles, "Best not, boy." (Behind him, [[Yevgeni Krushkin|Yevgeni]] grunts, then echoes, "Best not.")
- [[Karl Wachter|Karl]] scoffs. "Cowards, the lot of you," he says, glancing about him. "Not a funny bone in your bodies."
- [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] clears his throat. "Alas, my friends," he says, "but the day has been long, and I must retire. Another day, perhaps." As [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]] and [[Karl Wachter|Karl]] groan and turn back to their drinks, [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] bows with a flourish, then ascends the stairs to N2n Private Guest Room (p. 102).

Any player who watches as [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] makes his way along **N2j. Great Balcony** sees him pass [[Brom Martikov|Brom]] and [[Bray Martikov|Bray]], who are crouched along the balcony in front of **N2o. Boys' Bedroom**. (The boys are dangling the stuffed bat described in N2o. Boys' Bedroom (p. 102) over the bar below, giggling while [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]] and [[Karl Wachter|Karl]] drunkenly swat at it. The boys used the N2i. Secret Stairs and Hall (p. 101) to scamper quietly from the kitchen to the balcony while the players were drinking, unseen by the inn's patrons.)
### The Brother's Wachter

If the players linger at [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]]'s table, the Wachter brothers are happy (if prodded) to rant about:

- the Festival of the Blazing Sun,
- [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]'s recent history of festivals,
- the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]]'s response to those who speak ill of the festivals, and
- the flashes of purple light that have been seen from the attic of **N3. Burgomaster's Mansion**

Once the players have won the brothers' trust, they begin inquiring about their victory's and capabilities.

Through conversation, it becomes evident that the brothers have a deep, personal enmity toward [[Izek Strazni]] and the Vallakovich family. However, neither brother will reveal the underlying reason—[[Stella Wachter]]'s illness (see [[Arc H - The Lost Soul]])—unless the players ask and succeed on a DC 20 Charisma (Persuasion) check.

At some point during the conversation, [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] approaches the table to clear away empty plates. As she does, [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]] cheerfully demands more wine. If the players don't intervene, the conversation proceeds as follows:

- [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] greets [[Karl Wachter|Karl]] and [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]] by name, and asks, "Haven't you already had too much to drink, boys?"
- [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]] waves away her words and says, "Nonsense—we've only begun! Two pints of wine to start, and keep them coming."
- [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] replies, "Can I start you with some Purple Grapemash No. 3?" [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]] scoffs and says, "What do you take us for—tasteless peasants? Red Dragon Crush, and don't be stingy."
- As she pours their wine, [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] says idly, "Does your mother know what you're up to this evening?" [[Karl Wachter|Karl]] waits until he receives his pint, then grunts, "Mother's far too busy these days. And what she doesn't know can't hurt her." ("Or us," [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]] charms in, elbowing his brother. The two chuckle, then return to their drinks.)

If the players ask [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] or [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] about the Wachter brothers, [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] can tell them the information listed above. If the players ask about their mother, or about their words about a "stupid Baron," [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] becomes visibly uneasy, and promises to speak with the players further in the morning.
### Eating Dinner

Shortly after [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]]'s story concludes, if the players ordered dinner, [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] approaches their table with a tray of food. As she serves them, she is suddenly jostled from behind, sending one of the bowls of soup tumbling from her grasp. The two players sitting at the northernmost end of the table must make DC 10 Dexterity saving throws, catching the bowl on a success. (If both players succeed, the player with the higher result catches the bowl first. If neither player succeeds, the bowl topples onto the floor, spilling the soup.)

[[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] turns, revealing the culprit: a red-cheeked [[Brom Martikov]] wearing one of the painted wooden clown masks as described in N2o. Boy' Bedroom (p. 102). ([[Bray Martikov]], wearing the other mask of the pair, is cowering behind one of the chairs of the nearest table.)

If the players do not interrupt, [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] scolds the boys as follows:

- [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] sharply (though not unkindly) addresses [[Brom Martikov|Brom]] and [[Bray Martikov|Bray]] by their full names. Both children snap to attention.
- [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] asks the boys, "What did your father tell you about wearing those masks in the taproom?" Both boys remove their masks, flushed, and [[Brom Martikov|Brom]] says, sheepishly, "We're not supposed to do it."
- [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] then asks the boys, "And what did I tell you about running in the taproom?" The two are quiet, then [[Bray Martikov|Bray]] pipes up, " . . . we're not s'posed to do it?" [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] replies, "Exactly."

If the soup was spilled, [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] directs [[Bray Martikov|Bray]] to fetch a pail of water from **N2a. Well** outside, and [[Brom Martikov|Brom]] to fetch a mop from the kitchen to clean up the mess. If the soup wasn't spilled, [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] reminds the boys that they're supposed to be helping their father cook dinner, and shoos them into the kitchen.

In either case, [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] apologizes to the players and offers them free meals the following evening. If the players ask about [[Brom Martikov|Brom]] and [[Bray Martikov|Bray]], [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] smiles fondly and says, "They can be a handful sometimes, but they're good boys."

If the players ask about the children's masks, [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] tells them that [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] bought them from the local toymaker, [[Gadof Blinsky]], who works at N7. Blinsky Toys (p.118).

The taproom slowly clears out over the following two hours. [[Nikolai Wachter|Nikolai]] and [[Karl Wachter]] stumble outside and collapse in the inn's shed, too drunk to make their way home.

If the players rented rooms for the night, [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] eventually approaches their table and offers to show them to their rooms. (See **N2l. Guest Rooms** and N2m. Guest Room (p. 102)). During the tour, [[Danika Dorakova|Danika]] lets them know that they're free to request fresh linens or a tub of hot water (for a bath) be brought up to their rooms. "Breakfast is served at first light," she says warmly, and adds, "Feel free to let us know if you need anything else."

**_[[Getting Started#Level breakdown|Milestone]]._** When the players take their first long rest in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], award each player 1,000 XP. (This should bring the players to 4th level.) If the players successfully escorted [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], they earn an additional 250 XP. (The players don't need to bring [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to St. Andral's church to receive this XP.)
## C12c. Morning in Vallaki
---
### Urwin's Advice
When the players first emerge from their rooms onto N2k. Guest Balcony the following morning, [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]]—who is taking down the chairs from the taproom tables—asks them to come downstairs to the bar to speak.

Lowering his voice, [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] warns the players that they must be cautious in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]—both due to the town's harsh system of law enforcement and recent political tensions. [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] can share the following additional information, as described in Vallaki Lore (p. 96):

- The date of the Festival of the Blazing Sun, which will take place from dawn to noon of the players' fifth full day in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]],
- [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]'s recent history of festivals,
- The [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]]'s strict rules regarding his festivals—and the fates of those who speak ill of them,
- The brutish nature and terrible strength of [[Izek Strazni]], the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|baron]]'s henchman. ("Many have tried to test his strength," [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] notes grimly. "All have failed.")

[[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] quietly notes, however, that the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] is known to be highly susceptible to flattery—and that should the players ever need to win his favour, his ego may be a prime target.

If the players ask whether the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] has any enemies in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] can also share the information about [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] described in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] Lore (p. 96). However, instead of describing [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]]'s "mad daughter," [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] shares only that [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Fiona]] has a daughter, [[Stella Wachter]], who [[Lady Fiona Wachter|Lady Wachter]] has recently kept cloistered on the grounds of Wachterhaus for unknown reasons.

As [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]]'s conversation draws to a close, [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] descends the stairs from N2n. Private Guest Room and approaches the bar, greeting the players with a nod. [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] bids him good morning and removes a small parcel from beneath the counter, which [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] accepts and tucks into his cloak.

> [!example]- What's In the Parcel?
> If asked, [[Urwin Martikov|Urwin]] can inform the players that the parcel merely contains food—a few apples, some loaves of bread, and a wheel of cheese.

### Following the Ringmaster
If one or more players follow [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] out of [[#C12b. The Blue Water Inn|the Blue Water Inn]], they can follow him to N2f. Stable (p. 101) without difficulty.

Once inside, [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] removes the parcel from his coat, withdraws two apples, and proceeds to feed them to his horse, Drusilla. Once Drusilla has finished eating, [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] checks his surroundings, forcing any hidden players to succeed on a DC 18 group Dexterity (Stealth) check or be detected.

> [!info]- Group Checks
> See Group Checks (_Player's Handbook_, p. 175) for more information on how to use group ability checks.
> 
> When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the DM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.
> 
> To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.
> 
> Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the DM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.

> [!example]- Detecting Magic
> If a player casts _detect magic_ while in [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]]'s presence, they can immediately notice:
> 
> - the aura of illusion magic surrounding his _hat of disguise_,
> - the aura of enchantment magic surrounding his _ring of mind shielding_, and
> - the aura of abjuration magic surrounding his _amulet of proof against detection and location_, which he wears hidden beneath his shirt.

If he detects any players, [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] calls out to them and notes, amusedly, that it's impolite to lurk in dark places. He then light-heartedly interrogates them, doing his best to uncover their purpose in following him while avoiding revealing his true identity.

If asked who the food is for, [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] insists that it is for "my friend, the destitute toymaker." (He is referring to [[Gadof Blinsky]], described further in N7. Blinsky Toys (p. 118).)

If confronted regarding his magic items or true identity, [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] directs the players to check their surroundings for spies, then demands that they prove themselves not to be spies of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]. If the players respond persuasively, he then insists that they swear themselves to secrecy. If they do, his story changes as follows:

- If the players do not suspect his true identity, [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] "reveals" that he is a secret agent of the [[Keepers of the Feather]], a secret society dedicated to resisting [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]. (His true name, he claims, is classified, for fear that it may lead [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] to pursue his loved ones.)
- If the players do suspect his true identity, [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] "reveals" that he is Arthur Sedgwick, a former student of [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]] from a land beyond the Mists, who followed [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Dr. van Richten]] to Barovia when he heard the vampire hunter had gone missing.

These are lies. A DC 18 Wisdom (Insight) check indicates that [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]]'s eyes flicker upwards for a moment before he gives the Keepers' name or Arthur's. If further confronted, [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] denies any additional allegations. "Believe what you will," he concedes, shrugging. "What you think is no concern of mine."

[[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] declines to share further information for fear that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s agents might steal it from them.

If he fails to detect the players, [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] uses his _hat of disguise_ to assume the form of a random Vallakian commoner, then slips out of the stable onto the street. He then proceeds to weave through the streets and alleys of [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] in a paranoid attempt to lose any followers. A player attempting to follow him must succeed on a DC 18 Wisdom (Perception) check or lose him in the crowd.

> [!example]- Following Rictavio
> Once he departs the Blue Water Inn's stable, [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]] proceeds to Arasek Stockyard, where he slips the parcel of food through the slats of the rear door of his wagon. He then provides [[Arabelle]] a brief update on the town's activities as she eats, kneeling before the wagon as described in [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana]].
### Exiting the Inn
As the players depart [[#C12b. The Blue Water Inn|the Blue Water Inn]] on their first morning in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], they find the street full of townsfolk. Assuming the players do not interfere, the following scene then unfolds:

- The players hear the sound of a whinnying horse from down the street—and the townsfolk freeze and fall silent. A small procession lies to the south: [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich]] (as described in Roleplaying the Vallakovich Family, p. 105) riding upon his chestnut horse, flanked by his two **mastiffs** named Claw and Fang, and followed by three **guards**. [[Izek Strazni]] leads the procession.
- The players can see that an old, frightened-looking woman wearing threadbare commoner’s clothes has just stumbled away from the horse and fallen into a puddle of mud a few feet away from the horse. The horse has come to an abrupt halt, and the procession has stopped along with it. [[Izek Strazni|Izek]]’s devilish arm is outstretched, suggesting that he has just pushed—or flung—the old woman into the mud. (The woman is [[Willemina Rikalova]], the mother of the imprisoned shoemaker [[Udo Lukovich]].)
- The [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] angrily scolds the woman for getting mud on his cloak with her “filthy peasant’s hands.” The old woman, her voice quavering, apologizes and pleads with the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich]] to release her son, [[Udo Lukovich|Udo]], claiming that he meant no harm with his “foolish joke.”
- The [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] insists that [[Udo Lukovich|Udo]] needs “rehabilitation” for his “malicious unhappiness,” and suggests that the woman does as well. He commands [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] to seize her and lock her in the stocks, suggesting that “a few days in the stocks ought to tighten her tongue.” [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] steps forward, flexing his devilish arm with a cruel glint in his eye.
- [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] grabs the woman, hauls her to her feet, and thrusts her rudely into the guards’ waiting arms. Two of the guards pull the old woman’s arms behind her back and begin to pull her south as she struggles, weeps, and pleads for her son’s freedom. No townsfolk dare to help her.
- As the old woman is hauled away, the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] turns to the townsfolk surrounding him and announces: “Let that be a lesson as to the dangers of malicious unhappiness! The Devil’s hand is long, but our joy shall overcome his shadow.”

If the players interrupt [[Willemina Rikalova|Willemina]]’s arrest, the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] greets them as outsiders and asks, with amusement, whether they seek to claim responsibility for the “old fool’s” rehabilitation themselves.

**_Diplomacy._** If the players make a successful DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check or make an argument that sufficiently flatters the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]]’s ego, he directs the guards to release her into their custody. He welcomes them to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] and pompously commands them to ensure that they educate themselves as to the town’s rules and traditions.

**_Hostility._** If the players indicate a willingness to start a fight, the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]]’s eyes narrow and his mastiffs begin to growl. Meanwhile, [[Izek Strazni|Izek]]’s arm burns with a crimson flame, his grip tightening around the haft of his silvered battle-axe.

The [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] first demands to know whether the players are “spies of the Devil Strahd.” The players can attempt to calm the situation and secure [[Willemina Rikalova|Willemina]]’s arrest peacefully, but any subsequent Charisma checks made to sway the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] are made with disadvantage.

If it appears that combat is imminent, [[Father Lucian Petrovich]] (as described in N1. St. Andral's Church, p. 97) steps forth from the crowd and urges peace. The [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] greets him warmly by name, and [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Petrovich]] apologizes for [[Willemina Rikalova|Willemina]]’s behaviour, noting that she has been troubled in recent days at his congregations. He promises to escort her to St. Andral’s Church and see that her troubled mind is eased—a proposition that the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] reluctantly accepts.

> [!tip]- What's Lucian Doing Here?
> After discovering [[Arc D - St. Andral's Feast|St. Andral's missing bones]] and sending Yeska to recruit [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] to leave materials to repair the crypt, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Petrovich]] sought out [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vallakovich]] in the hopes of obtaining his help in finding the bones. He decided against it, however, after observing the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]]'s mood and behaviour in the streets. ([[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] doesn't share this unless he's already told the players about the missing bones in [[Arc D - St. Andral's Feast]]. He will, however, share that he was hoping to ask the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] about something, but decided against it after seeing the man's current mood.)

The [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] also wonders aloud whether he should punish the players for their insolence. [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Petrovich]] assures the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] that they are merely outsiders, untaught in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]’s ways, and that he shall see to it that they are properly educated.

The [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] imperiously orders that he see to it, then informs the players that they have caught him “in a good mood,” and that they should be grateful for “the Morninglord’s mercy.” He warns them, however, that future lawbreaking shall be met with harsh punishments.

**_Departure._** As the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] departs the scene, he announces to the crowd: “I shall expect to see you all at the Festival of the Blazing Sun four days hence. All will be well!”

The townsfolk, bearing smiles that better resemble grimaces, grimly intone, “All will be well.” The [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] nods, evidently satisfied, and continues riding north, followed by [[Izek Strazni|Izek]], his mastiffs, and any remaining guards. The activity of the street resumes shortly thereafter.

If [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is with the party, she has drawn up the hood of her cloak upon exiting the inn. Nonetheless, unless the party has taken specific action to prevent [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] from noticing her, he catches [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]’s eye and holds her gaze for a long, lingering moment before ultimately departing, leaving [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] feeling uncomfortable and cold. [[Arc G - The Strazni Siblings]] then begins.

If asked, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] notes with uncertainty that something about [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] seemed almost familiar, though she can’t remember why.

If the players defied [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Vargas Vallakovich]] or [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] in any way, or otherwise assisted [[Willemina Rikalova|Willemina]], [[Ernst Larnak]] reports their actions to [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] at Wachterhaus. [[Arc F - Lady Wachter's Wish]] then begins.

**_End of an Act._** When the players set off from [[#C12b. The Blue Water Inn|the Blue Water Inn]] for their first full day in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], **Act I** ends and **Act II** begins.

# Design Notes: Into the Valley 

## Journey to Vallaki 
---
**_The Lansten Family._** The encounters with the Barovian scouts and the undead Lansten family have been added to underscore the tragedy of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s siege on [[the village of Barovia]], to introduce [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s undead forces, and to foreshadow [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s ultimate plan to turn the [[Barovians]] into undead to forge his new army upon escaping the Mists.

**_Encounter with Strahd._** Many community encounters with [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] create situations in which, in order to drive home [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s power and cruelty, the players inevitably "lose." Such encounters are likely to frustrate players and engender apathy or despair instead of a tense, yet enjoyable gameplay experience. However, it is equally important that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] not be allowed to "lose" his initial encounter with the players, even by proxy (e.g., combat with his minions). To allow [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s power to be questioned at this stage would fundamentally undermine his capacity as a villain.

As such, this encounter intentionally creates a circumstance in which both [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] and the players can "win" by the end—the players, by convincing [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] to let them and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] go, and [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], by gleaning useful information from the players' arguments and by clearly signalling that he is merely humoring their efforts.

While running this scene, recall the wise words of Tywin Lannister: "Any man who must say 'I am the king' is no true king." So too for [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]: allowing the players to successfully irritate, annoy, or otherwise drive him to "punish them" functionally allows the players to gain a certain measure of control over the conversation, reducing [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s appearance of real and apparent control, and indicating that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] is a petty noble who cares about his own ego. Always remember that, especially at this stage, the players _cannot hurt_ [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] in any meaningful way—and, as such, he feels no need to hurt _them_ in any meaningful way.

Altogether, the intended effect of this encounter is to introduce the players to [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], make the players hate and fear him, put the players on notice of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s minions and servants, to reassure the players that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] will be an inevitable antagonist, and to make the players appreciate [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s Lawful Evil alignment—that, while inhabiting his Gentleman, he will do them no harm until and unless they give him reason to do so.

**_The Strix._** The greater and lesser strix have been introduced to provide [[Baba Lysaga]] and the druids of Yester Hill with a meaningful way of combating the wereravens of the [[Keepers of the Feather]]. [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]] has also been added here to foreshadow the [[Keepers of the Feather]], to foreshadow [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s prophecy (which the players will have an opportunity to learn after defeating the druids at Yester Hill), and to continue setting up [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]]'s existence before her formal introduction at the beginning of the winery quest.

**_Changes to Lycanthropy._** Due to the game-breaking impact that a lycanthrope player character can have on your game, it has been intentionally made as difficult as possible to achieve the full benefits of the curse. This version creates clear-cut rules to delineate lycanthropes who have "embraced" their curse and those that have not, and ensures that these rules rely on character-driven storytelling, rather than arbitrary game mechanics.

Lycanthropic immunity has been changed to silver-based regeneration in order to ensure that lycanthropes resonate with common understandings of lycanthropy and to ensure that all classes can meaningfully contribute to a lycanthrope's defeat, with or without magic weapons or spell. Lycanthropes have also been made weak to necrotic damage (in addition to damage from silvered weapons) in order to provide creative players with an alternate means of halting their regeneration and (more importantly) to explain how [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], who owns no silver weapons, is able to keep the werewolves in line.

**_The Tarokka Reading._** [[Madam Eva]]'s warnings at the beginning of the reading have been added to increase the tension of the reading, to ensure that players treat it with the weight and care that it deserves, and to introduce a minor element of dramatic intrigue in the scenes that follow.

**_[[Arturi Radanavich]]._** [[Arturi Radanavich]] is a creation of the _Advanced Dungeons & Dragons_ sourcebook _[[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]]'s Guide to the [[Vistani]]._ His tale (and his character) have largely been transplanted directly into this guide in order to further introduce [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]]'s legend (and tragedy), to provide an explanation for [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]]'s transformation into a more sympathetic character, to introduce Ezmerelda d'Avenir, and to create player investment in [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]]'s history upon uncovering his burned journal in [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]]'s Tower.

**_The Dancing Fire._** The Game of Stories has been introduced to provide the players with an opportunity to decompress in a relatively safe location while engaging with and exploring one anothers' histories and interests. The Game itself—along with its wagers—introduces an aspect of dramatic tension to the encounter, ensuring that players remain invested and engaged with each story told.

[[Stanimir]]'s tale indicates the relationship between [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] and the [[Vistani]], thereby foreshadowing Arrigal's loyalty to him. [[Eliza]]'s tale introduces the _Holy Symbol of Ravenkind_ and the sympathetic nature of ravens, as well as Baba Zelenna's interference with the Forest Fane at Yester Hill (i.e., by using it to summon Chernovog). [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]]'s tale colorfully introduces the tragedy of [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten]], building the suspense for a character that the players will soon have an opportunity to meet. Finally, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s tale foreshadows her relationship to [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] Strazni and her true origins in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]].

**_A Gift for Arabelle._** [[Madam Eva]]'s request has been added to create a hook to Blinsky Toys in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] (allowing the players to observe [[Izek Strazni|Izek]]'s commissioned [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]-shaped doll) and to the [[Vistani]] encampment outside of [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] (allowing the players to begin the quest to find the missing [[Arabelle]]).

**_The Skeletal Rider._** The encounter with the skeletal rider is a short, but evocative scene that aims to resonate with the themes of undeath, loneliness, and mystery that infuse this arc.

**_The Watchtower._** This short landmark serves to foreshadow the tragedy of the [[Barovian refugees]], the fate of [[the Order of the Silver Dragon]], and the bloodstained history of the valley.

**_Tser Falls._** The encounter with the revenant has been added to provide the players with a clear, though non-urgent hook to Argynvostholt. The revenant's responses are intentionally kept terse in order to ensure that the players learn little of [[the Order of the Silver Dragon]] until their meeting with Sir Godfrey Gwilym.

**_Meeting Morgantha._** This scene has been intentionally structured to discourage the players from uncovering [[Morgantha, Dream Peddler|Morgantha]]'s true identity, attacking the night hags, or entering Old Bonegrinder. (They will have a full opportunity to do so later in [Arc H - The Lost Soul](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+II+-+The+Shadowed+Town/Arc+H+-+The+Lost+Soul).) Instead, this scene merely introduces [[Morgantha, Dream Peddler|Morgantha]] as a character, foreshadows her domain over dreams, and informs the players that she lives in the old windmill with her two daughters (i.e., her coven).

**_The Deep Woods._** The swarms of ravens have been added to ensure that the players view ravens (and, by extension, wereravens) as friends and allies. [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s reaction to Lake Zarovich has been added to further foreshadow her relationship to [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] and her origins in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]].

**_The Werewolf's Hunt._** This brief combat encounter introduces werewolves and provides the swarms of ravens (and [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]]) with an opportunity to assist and defend the players. The wolves' **_Maul_** action option has been added to create a more tense and dynamic combat scenario.

## Welcome to Vallaki 
---
**_The Refugee Camp._** The Barovian refugee camp has been placed here to provide the players with an additional reason to hate [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vallakovich]] and [[Izek Strazni|Izek]], and to provide [[Morgantha, Dream Peddler|Morgantha]] with a natural constituency for her dream pastries. By rejecting [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s efforts to help them, the refugees progress her character arc by allowing her to realize that she cannot help her people so long as [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] survives, which fuels her ultimate decision to join the party in their fight.

**_The Tax._** The guards' tax gives the players an additional reason to hate [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vallakovich]]. The silver tariff also indicates to the players the wealth of silvered weapons and ammunition that the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] has hoarded.

**_The Blue Water Inn._** This sequence has been intentionally structured to slowly and manageably introduce the players to several of the key players in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]: the Martikovs, the Wachters, the wolf-hunters, and the ringmaster [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]]. [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Rictavio]]'s tale has been written to be as comedic as reasonably possible in order to discourage the players from taking him seriously until the reveal of his identity in [Arc E - The Missing Vistana](https://www.strahdreloaded.com/Act+II+-+The+Shadowed+Town/Arc+E+-+The+Missing+Vistana).

**_Exiting the Inn._** The players' encounter with [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron Vallakovich]] and [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] on the roads of [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] has been added to provide the players with an immediate reason to dislike them, to introduce the players to [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] Petrovich, to set up the core dramatic tension of the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]]'s tyrannical rule over [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], to kick off [[Izek Strazni|Izek]]'s pursuit of [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], and to provide Lady Fiona Wachter with an actionable reason to invite the players into her machinations. **It is essential that the players do _not_ fight [[Izek Strazni|Izek]] here, and all reasonable precautions have been taken to ensure this.**
