In this act, the players are lured into the haunted [[Arc A - Escape from Death House|Death House]], which mystically transports them into the land of Barovia. As the players gain their bearings, they travel to [[the village of Barovia]], where they meet burgomaster [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] and his sister, [[Ireena Kolyana]], and learn about the mysterious [[Strahd von Zarovich]], a vampire that has recently awoken to plague the Barovian valley.

The players are asked to escort [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to the nearby town of [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] for safety; if the players agree, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] also asks them to assist in the burial of her late father, [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich]]. While at the local church, the players meet [[Doru]], a **vampire spawn** at war with his bloodthirsty nature, and have an opportunity to reconcile him with his father, the priest [[Father Donavich|Donavich]].

Upon receiving a warning and invitation sent in a dream from the [[Vistani]] seer [[Madam Eva]], the players depart [[the village of Barovia]] for a [[Vistani]] encampment at nearby Tser Pool. Following a brief encounter with [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] himself, the players receive a mystical Tarokka reading from [[Madam Eva]], who foretells the location of three mystical artifacts—and a companion—who will help them defeat [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]].

As the players travel to [[Madam Eva]]'s camp and the nearby town of [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], they encounter a number of characters with ties to possible future adventures, as well as some adversarial encounters that will test their tactics, coordination, and combat skill.

Upon their arrival in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], the players can find shelter at the Blue Water Inn, and—if she is with them—help [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] seek shelter at St. Andral’s Church. The act ends when the players take their first long rest in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]].
