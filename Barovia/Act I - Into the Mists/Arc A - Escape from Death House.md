# A1. Greyhallow
## A1a. The Wanking Goblin
---

> [!cutscene] Read the following text to players using the Barovian Relics hook:
> It’s the evening before Harvestwake, and a storm has descended over Greyhallow, with dark clouds pouring cascades of rain down upon the town below. Despite the weather, however, the town buzzes with anticipation of the impending falltime festival, each home filled with warmth and joy. Bright, cheery candlelight twinkles from every window, and the sounds of song and dance echo throughout the wet and muddy streets.
> 
> Amidst the merriment, however, you stand apart. Neither locals nor visitors, you’re vagabonds—travelers, ghosts passing through an unfamiliar town. As laughter rings out from inns and homes, you face a simpler, starker dilemma: the quest for shelter.
> 
> Every room in this town is claimed, every hearth filled to bursting, leaving you in the grip of the bitter storm. Until, that is, the owner of the ramshackle Wanking Goblin tavern offers you a grudging reprieve: the hayloft above their stable. It’s nothing to boast about, leaving the biting cold and the lingering scent of musty hay as your only companions. But it’s a roof over your heads nonetheless—a small mercy on a night such as this.

Invite the players to describe their character's appearance and countenance as they enter the hayloft, how they’ve positioned themselves once they're in, and how they’ve arranged their belongings.

> [!cutscene] After all players using the Barovian Relics hook have introduced themselves, continue:
> One by one, you find a home amidst the muck and hay. Overhead, rain lashes the stable, thunder punctuating the rhythmic drumming on the roof. Flashes of lightning lance across the skies, casting the stable’s interior in stark lights and darks. Rainwater drips steadily down through a leak in the roof, snaking its way across the floor until it pools in the corner.
> 
> Here, then, you find yourselves: huddled in the darkness amongst strangers, while joy and mirth dance just out of reach.

Allow the players to roleplay from here, more a brief greeting than a introduction.

> [!cutscene] Read the following during an appropriate point in the conversation:
> A searing bolt of lightning rends the sky, illuminating the evening in a blinding flash of stark white. The booming thunder that follows is so loud it shakes the very ground beneath you, causing the timbers of the stable to creak and groan.
> 
> The light of the strike lingers unnaturally, silhouetting small wisps of fog that twist through the air. A thick, ankle-deep mist gathers outside, shrouding the earth in a ghostly veil. Its tendrils curl invitingly, as though beckoning you to the darkness beyond.
> 
> The rain continues to pelt the roof above, but the wind no longer howls, and the merry sounds of Greyhallow’s festivities seem muted and distant. The horses in the stable beneath stir uneasily, their whinnies echoing loudly in the stillness. An uneasy feeling sweeps through the hayloft, a cold shiver that has nothing to do with the wind or rain.

> [!tip]- One by one, the player's relics react, in the following order:
> 
>  - **_The Stone Crest._** The crest emits a low hum and smells of pine needles and earthy soil, which both grow stronger when the crest is moved toward Death House.
> - **_Broken Blade._** The blade emits a high-pitched hum and begins to tremble violently, spinning like a compass needle in the direction of Death House.
> - **_Dragon's Scale._** The scale burns icy cold, one end glowing with a bright, silver light in the direction of Death House.
> - **_Sunrise Medallion._** The medallion shines with a warm, golden glow, emitting rays of bright light in the direction of Death House.
> - **_Amber Shard._** The shard glows with amber light and tugs its cord in the direction of Death House.
> - **_Wolf's Tooth._** The tooth lengthens, glowing with silver moonlight, and tugs its cord in the direction of Death House.
> - **_Crumpled Page._** The ink on the page glows with amber light, the runes reshaping themselves into a map that shows the page's location—and an arrow that guides toward Death House.
> - **_Tattered Banner._** The sound of war-drums fills the air, and the banner blows in an unseen wind in the direction of Death House.
> - **_Electrum Coin._** The coin lands on its edge and begins rolling across the muddy cobblestones in the direction of Death House.
> - **_Angel's Feather._** The feather is swept away by an unseen wind, its barbs glimmering with golden light as it twirls through the streets toward Death House.
> - **_Raven's Feather._** The feather is swept away by the wind, its shadow seeming to dance in the air, as it twirls through the streets toward Death House.
> - **_Wanderer's Scarf._** The scarf is carried away by the wind, its patterns shifting and turning in the air as it whirls through the streets toward Death House.

Give the players the chance to respond before continuing.

> [!cutscene] If the players give chase read:
> You emerge from the hayloft into the swirling mists beyond, the stones of Greyhallow's streets slick and gleaming beneath your feet. The city’s laughter and cheer is now but a hollow echo, the brightness of its revelry drowned in the fog that encircles you. The taste of the cold, damp air is sharp on your tongue, and the sound of your own breath loud in your ears.
> 
> Your relics call you forward, the mists parting to make way. You move slowly at first, then faster, your hearts pounding in your chest. As you venture deeper into the fog, each step you take feels heavier, each echo of thunder a beat in this relentless march.
> 
> The fog swallows the town, buildings reduced to looming shadows, their shapes dancing and flickering in the storm's sporadic flashes of lightning. Rain drums a relentless rhythm, the patter of drops on cobblestone accompanying the distant, mournful peal of thunder. For brief moments, you can feel something else beneath your feet: the steady pounding of a deep and distant heartbeat.
> 
> You're pulled left, then right, then left again, the relics guiding you through the murky labyrinth. Distance and direction have lost all meaning, the shadows around you contorting in twisted shapes. Your blood sings in your ears, and the air grows denser, electric, as the energy of the storm—of the chase—swells with reckless abandon.
> 
> And then—the pounding stops.
> 
> The thunder pauses.
> 
> And the mist breaks.
> 
> The fog pulls back like a curtain, revealing a tall, eerie silhouette that towers in the gloom before you.

The players using the Barovian Relics hook arrive at Death House.
# A2. Death House

> [!cutscene] If one or more players are using the Lost in the Mists hook, read:
> Highharvesttide in Daggerford. It’s a time of joy and celebration, of hearth and home, of golden laughter ringing out into the night. But tonight, as a storm has swept over the town, you find yourselves apart from the warmth and revelry, drawn into the cold, dark embrace of mystery.
> 
> As mercenaries, you're no strangers to danger or the unknown. But this—this is different. Over the past few weeks, whispers have spread throughout Daggerford of disappearances: ordinary folk, vanished without a trace.
> 
> The only connection? A grand, old manor, known in hushed tones as “Death House.”
> 
> Tonight, as the storm rages outside, you've been summoned to investigate this mysterious dwelling. The town crier’s proclamation still echoes in your ears, a bounty for any brave souls who dare to uncover the truth. Driven by a mix of greed, curiosity, and perhaps a touch of bravado, you stepped forward.
> 
> Now, guided by the faint glow of your lanterns, you traverse the slick, fog-shrouded cobblestone streets together. The distant merriment is a stark contrast to the eerie quiet around you. The world has been reduced to hushed whispers and the steady drumming of rain, a sombre serenade to your perilous journey.

Invite each player in turn to describe their character's appearance and countenance as they walk with the group. Allow the players to roleplay from here, more a brief greeting than a introduction.

> [!cutscene] Read the following during an appropriate point in the conversation:
> And then, as if answering an unspoken summons, the mists before you part, revealing the grim silhouette of your destination: the “Death House.” Its dark, stone façade and towering spires loom ominously against the storm-tossed sky, a wordless challenge against your resolve.
## A2a. The Arrival
---
### Entrance (1)

> [!cutscene] Read the following to all players:
> A grand manor stands before you, four stories of cold, soot-stained stone, tall narrow windows, and high peaked roofs forming a picture of austere, chilling grandeur. Midway up, a narrow balcony juts out from the third floor, offering a grim perch from which to survey the surrounding grounds.
> 
> The centerpiece of this imposing facade is the portico, a stone arch standing sentinel before the house's oaken doors. A wrought-iron gate fills this arch, its rusty hinges creaking as it sways in the wind.
> 
> On either side of the gate, oil lamps hang from chains, their light dim and flickering, casting a sickly glow that barely pierces the surrounding fog.
> 
> Beyond the gate, a set of sturdy oaken doors stand closed, framed by the gate and the lamps. The doors are old and weathered, their wood darkened by time, but they stand strong and proud—an unwelcome entrance to the house beyond.
> 
> A gust of wind sweeps past you, carrying with it a whisper of cold dread that sends shivers down your spine.

> [!tip]- One by one, each relic reacts as follows when the players reach Death House, in the following order:
> 
>  - **_The Stone Crest._** The crest's hum peaks, and smells of pine needles and earthy soil fills the air around you now. It seems this is the place it was trying to lead you.
> - **_Broken Blade._** The blade appears to be pointing directly at the building, as if at something deep within its walls.
> - **_Dragon's Scale._** The scale burns icy cold in your hand, the glow now resting on the building before you, as if trying to shine onto something deep within its walls.
> - **_Sunrise Medallion._** The medallion shines brighter now, its light now resting on the building before you, as if trying to shine onto something deep within its walls.
> - **_Amber Shard._** The shard glows and tussles around your neck, attempting to pull you further, into the building that stands before you.
> - **_Wolf's Tooth._** The tooth tussles around your neck, attempting to pull you further, into the building that stands before you.
> - **_Crumpled Page._** The two points on the page are nearly converged. It seems this building is where the page led you.
> - **_Tattered Banner._** The unseen winds howl, blowing towards the building before you.
> - **_Electrum Coin._** The coin rolls towards the door of the building before you, before its momentum slows near its porch. It spins limply in place as it comes to a stop, as if beckoning you further.
> - **_Angel's Feather._** The feather lands gently on the porch of the building before you, its gentle radiance in stark contrast with the building.
> - **_Raven's Feather._** The feather lands gently on the porch of the building before you, the scent of rain still heavy around it.
> - **_Wanderer's Scarf._** The scarf lands gently on the porch of the building before you, its shifting patterns slowing as if it waits for you.

### Main Hall (2a)

Upon entering, any Barovian relics cease activity.

> [!cutscene] When the players enter, read:
> You enter into what appears to be a wide ornate hall, running the full width of the house, the cold sweeping air from the storm behind you at odds with the looming din of the space inside. A black marble fireplace sits stoic at one end of the hall, while a sweeping, red marble staircase climbs further into the house at the other. A large Grandfather Clock stands tall in the nook of the staircase, casting striking shadows that dance against the back wall.
> 
> Your gaze wonders around to the walls and décor; Wood-panelled walls ornately sculpted with images of vines, flowers, nymphs, and satyrs, each in playful poses that dance in macabre shapes in the flickering din from the fireplace.
> 
> Hung high on the wall, above the fireplace, is the wood-framed portrait of a strange family. A plaque beneath it reads: 
> 
> _Mr. Gustav and Mrs. Elisabeth Durst, with their two children, [[Rosavalda Durst|Rosavalda]] and [[Thornboldt Durst|Thornboldt]]._

Show the players the following handout.

> [!handout]- Handout - "The Durst Family" by Caleb Cleveland.
> ![[Durst Family by Caleb Cleveland.png]]
> ^600f8d

After the players witness the portrait and react, the doors slam shut behind the players, extinguishing all lights in the house. With it, the sound of the storm outside completely vanishes, leaving only the eerie silence of the house.

Bloody letters then appear on the southern wall just above the staircase.

> [!cutscene] They read as follows:
> _Beneath this dwelling lurks a beast_  
_Who hungers for a bloody feast._  
_He sleeps until the midnight chime_  
_Then wakes to feed his dark design._  
_If morsels seek to flee their doom,_  
_Then bring toward his secret room_  
_A gift to soothe his savage mood_  
_But mind the servants of his brood._
>^65ed60

The Grandfather clock then strikes six o'clock.

> [!tip]+ Time in Death House
> When the clock strikes six, place three six-sided dice on the table in front of the players, with each side showing a six. Each pip on the dice represents twenty minutes until midnight.
> 
> As the players explore the house, tick this dice clock downward to indicate the passage of time, always starting with the die showing the lowest number. If the lowest die shows a one, you can tick it down to “zero” by removing it from the group instead.
> 
> The dice clock counts down as follows to represent the total time the players have spent in the house:
> - Each time the players enter a new floor of the house or dungeon, tick the dice clock down by one.
> - Each time the players make a Perception or Investigation check to search an entire room, tick the dice clock down by one.
> - Each time the players complete a short rest, tick the dice clock down by three.
> 
A full hour passes each time a die decreases from 4 to 3, or each time a die decreases from 1 to 0. The grandfather clock in the **Main Hall** sounds on the hour, every hour, and can be heard throughout the house and dungeon.
>
When the clock strikes midnight, the **flesh mound** in the **Ritual Chamber** awakens and makes a beeline for the players, exiting through the **Hidden Trapdoor** into the **Den of Wolves** if necessary to reach them. At least one minute should pass between the time the mound wakes up and the time that it first reaches the players, nullifying its _heavy sleeper_ feature and allowing it to use its _multiattack_ actions.

> [!tip]- Resting in Death House
> Due to their midnight deadline, it is impossible for the players to take a long rest in Death House. However, the players might still need to take a short rest. Each time they do so in the main house, they experience one or more of the following hauntings:
> 
>- A player hears rats scrabbling up and down the spaces between the walls. A thick, choking stench of rot seeps into the room.
>- A player hears the sound of a woman’s humming emanating from the opposite side of a closed door. If the door is cracked open, a cold blue eye stares back before vanishing.
>- A player hears footsteps descending from the attic, which stop outside of their door before moving away to the library. Soon after, a grinding noise can be heard coming from the library—the sound of the secret door.
>- A figure unfamiliar to the players stands next to them in their reflection, but not in the material plane. When they look away, it disappears.
>- A player hears maniacal laughter echoing from far below the house.
>- A player hears a pleading female voice in their right ear that swears that “it isn’t his.” Another, colder female voice in the player’s left ear scoffs and says, "You would say that, you little _harlot_."

> [!warning] Leaving Death House
> A player who opens any outside-facing door or curtain in Death House, or who exits onto any balcony, finds that the exterior of the house has been surrounded by thick, fleshy tendrils. Although the tendrils can be damaged, more grow back swiftly to replace them, sealing the players inside. A player who inspects the tendrils finds that they appear to be extruding from beneath the house.
> 
> I have found it affective that the tendrils try and attack any player outside. Make it obvious that the tendrils will attack (such as them rearing up and darting towards the outdoor player,) then have the players narrowly avoid the oncoming attack should they try and evade it, having them duck back into the house for safety.
> 
> All windowed rooms give a view of the tendrils, along with the balcony's found in [[#Balcony (11)]] and [[#Nursemaid's Suite (15)]]

Characters who search the walls for secret doors or otherwise inspect the panelling can, with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, see serpents and skulls inconspicuously woven into the wall designs. A Windmill is carved lovingly at the centre of the north wall. The decorative panelling follows the staircase as it circles upward to the second floor.

> [!cutscene] When the players open the door to the room, read:
> As you crack the door to this room open, you catch a glimpse of something feral beyond: an amber eye that flashes in the darkness, and a bestial muzzle curled into a snarl.

Give the players a moment to react.

> [!cutscene] If the players proceed, read:
> The door open away from you, revealing a gray-furred wolf frozen into place. It's only a moment before you realize that it's not moving—and another before you realize that it's not alone.
> 
> This oak-panelled room looks like a hunter's den. Mounted above the fireplace is a stag's head, and positioned around the outskirts of the room are two additional stuffed wolves—a large gray wolf and a smaller brown wolf.
> 
> Two padded chairs draped in animal furs face a hearth, with an oak table between them supporting an assortment of objects. A chandelier hangs above a cloth-covered table surrounded by four chairs, and two cabinets stand against the walls. A pair of small toys seems to have been forgotten beneath one of the chairs.

The discarded toys are small, plush gray wolves, whose threadbare coats show evidence of heavy mending and patchwork. Clumsy stitchwork on their stomachs reads [[Rosavalda Durst|ROSE]] and [[Thornboldt Durst|THORN]], respectively.

The eastern cabinet is locked, requiring a successful DC 15 Dexterity check (Thieves' Tools.)

**Range.** A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range shown in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's maximum range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.

>**Ammunition.** You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack. Loading a one-handed weapon requires a free hand. At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.

The first time that no players are looking at them, the three taxidermized wolves move. When the players next look at them, the large gray wolf is standing beside the smaller brown wolf, and the first gray wolf has turned its snarl toward the others.

A player that succeeds on a DC 12 Intelligence (Nature) check can identify the large gray wolf as male and the other two as female.
### Dining Room (5)

Players that approach this door can hear the muffled sound of a lively dinner feast, including clinking glasses, quiet laughter, and distant conversation. If the players open or knock on the door, however, the room falls silent, leaving only the stillness and the cold grandeur of the room beyond.

> [!cutscene] When the players enter, read:
> You enter into a wood-paneled dining room. The centerpiece is a carved mahogany table surrounded by eight high-backed chairs with sculpted armrests and cushioned seats. A crystal chandelier hangs above the table, which is set with resplendent silverware and crystal glasses polished to a dazzling shine. Mounted above the marble fireplace is a mahogany-framed painting of an alpine vale.
> 
> The wall panelling is carved with elegant images of deer among the trees. Red silk drapes cover the windows, and a tapestry hangs from an iron rod bolted to the south wall.
> 
> The table groans beneath the weight of a delicious-looking feast. Exquisite dishes lay on grand platters: succulent roasted poultry glazed with a shimmering honey sauce, perfectly grilled cuts of beef still steaming lightly, a variety of cheeses and fresh fruits, and freshly baked breads giving off a comforting aroma.

Players can enjoy the food with no ill effects.

Characters who search the walls for secret doors or otherwise inspect the panelling can, with a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check, see twisted faces carved into the tree trunks and wolves lurking amid the carved foliage.

The tapestry depicts hunting dogs and horse-mounted aristocrats chasing after a wolf.

The silverware tarnishes, the crystal cracks, the portrait fades, and the tapestry rots if removed from the house.

> [!warning]- Design Notes: The Dining Room
> The feast in the dining room has been made intentionally harmless in order to encourage the players to trust the safety of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s dinner invitation when they later receive it.

### Kitchen and Pantry (4)


> [!cutscene] When the players enter, read:
> You enter a tidy kitchen, with dishware, cookware, and utensils neatly placed on shelves. A worktable has a cutting board and rolling pin atop it. A stone, dome-shaped oven stands near the east wall, its bent iron stovepipe connecting to a hole in the ceiling. Behind the stove and to the left is a thin door.
> 
> In the front right-hand corner of the room stands a small wooden door set into the wall.

The largest kitchen knife is missing.

In the pantry, there's a set of beautiful decorative plates painted with pictures of windmills. One of the plates appears to have been knocked off of the shelf and lies in shattered pieces on the floor, leaving an empty spot in the row of plates. 
A few inches behind the empty spot on the shelf sits an antique copper pot, its lid slightly ajar. Peeking out from beneath the lid is the cork of what appears to be a bottle of wine.

The copper pot contains:
- **A Bottle of Wine.** The wine's label shows that it is from the Wizard of Wines winery and provides the name of the wine: Champagne du le Stomp. (A player that drinks the wine finds it to have turned to vinegar, as though it has magically aged centuries in mere moments.)
- **A folded piece of delicate lace.** The piece of lace bears the initial "K" sewn onto one corner.
- **A vial of a brownish dried powder.** A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Nature) check identifies the brown powder as dried silphium, a contraceptive herb.
- **A bouquet of wilted sunflowers tied to a small scroll of parchment.** The parchment scroll reads: "For the light of my life. —G." When a player reads the note, one of the knives in the kitchen flies off its shelf and embeds itself in the opposite wall, barely missing the player.

The dumbwaiter is behind a small door in the southwest corner. A 2-foot-wide stone shaft containing a wooden elevator box attached to a simple rope-and-pulley mechanism that must be operated manually. The shaft connects to [[#Servants' Room (7)]] and 12A (the master bedroom). Hanging on the wall next to the dumbwaiter is a tiny brass bell attached by wires to buttons in those other areas.

A Small character can squeeze into the elevator box with a successful DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The dumbwaiter's rope-and-pulley mechanism can support 200 pounds of weight before breaking.

> ^a81b80

Close inspection of the carvings of the wall and a successful DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals that the youths aren't really dancing but fighting off swarms of bats.

A cold draft can be felt coming down the steps from the floor above.

### Servants' Room (7)

> [!cutscene] When the player's enter, read:
> This undecorated bedroom contains a pair of beds with straw-stuffed mattresses. At the foot of each bed is a closed foot locker. A door to the left appears to lead to a closet.
> 
> In the right-hand corner stands a small wooden door, a metal button set into the wall beside it. A basket full of unwashed laundry appears to have been left beside it.

The foot lockers are empty.

Tidy servants' uniforms hang from hooks in the closet (area 7b.)

The basket contains a man's laundry, including fine suits, tunics, neckties, pants, and stockings. However, a single, much-smaller woman's slip appears to have been mixed in with the rest.

The dumbwaiter in the corner of the west wall has a button on the wall next to it. Pressing the button rings a tiny bell in the [[#Kitchen and Pantry (4)]].

When the players approach this door, they hear the faint sound of a harpsichord playing from beyond the doors. If a player opens the door or knocks, the music falls silent.

> [!cutscene] When the players enter, read:
> You enter into an elegantly appointed hall, the windows of which are covered by gossamer drapes. A brass-plated chandelier hangs from the ceiling, and upholstered chairs line the walls.
> 
> Several stained-glass wall hangings depict beautiful men, women, and children singing and playing instruments. A harpsichord with a bench rests in the northwest corner. Near the fireplace is a large standing harp. Alabaster figurines of well-dressed dancers adorn the mantelpiece.

**_The Harpsichord._** A player who inspects the harpsichord finds that one of the keys appears to be permanently pressed in the "down" position. A player who investigates the interior of the harpsichord finds the cause: a rolled-up piece of parchment tucked beneath one of the strings. 

The parchment is a piece of handwritten sheet music for the harpsichord titled _Waltz for Klara_.

> [!cutscene] If the sheet music is played on the harpsichord, read:
> As you press your fingers to the keys, the notes echo, a haunting melody filling the quiet, dusty room. As you continue to play, the music seems to take on a life of its own, your hands moving across the keys unbidden as if guided by an unseen force.
> 
> From the edges of the room, spectral figures begin to materialize, spinning and weaving in a ghostly dance as though led by the song. Most are unfamiliar to you, but you recognize two: Elisabeth Durst, in the corner, watching Gustav's apparition dancing with a beautiful young woman wearing humble clothes.
> 
> The eyes of Elisabeth's apparition narrow into a cold, furious stare. The dancers pay her little heed, however, the song growing faster as the spirits whirl to the rhythm of the harpsichord's crescendo.
> 
> With a swift movement, Elisabeth reaches for a pendant around her spectral neck—a shimmering amber shard hung on a cord of ethereal mist. As her ghostly fist curls around it, her eyes flash a bright, menacing amber—and the spectral dancers dissipate, swept away as if by an unseen wind.
> 
> Elisabeth's apparition lingers but a moment longer before disappearing with the rest. As it does, a sound resonates through the room: the low sound of scraping wood, originating from the room across the hall. The floor trembles faintly—and you hear a crash from the mantelpiece. Two of the alabaster figurines have fallen from their place on the shelf: one, toppled over on its side; the other, shattered across the floor.
> ^00c75e

The toppled figurine (representing Klara) has cracked across its face, arms, and torso, and depicts a young and slender female dancer.
The shattered figurine (representing Gustav) has broken into dozens of pieces, and appears to have once depicted a comely, older man.
A third, female dancer figurine (representing Elisabeth) remains defiantly standing atop the mantelpiece where all three once stood.

The player that played *Waltz for Klara* feels a compulsion to pick it back up.

>  ^1b3641

Playing Waltz for Klara also causes the bookshelf—**not the secret door behind it**—in the [[#Library (8)]] to swing open, exposing the locked secret door beyond. (The scraping sound is the sound of the bookshelf scraping against the floor.)

> Red velvet drapes cover the windows of this room. An exquisite mahogany desk and a matching high-back chair face the entrance and the fireplace, above which hangs a framed picture of a windmill perched atop a rocky crag. Situated in corners of the room are two overstuffed chairs.
> 
> Floor-to-ceiling bookshelves line the south wall. A rolling wooden ladder allows one to more easily reach the high shelves.

**_The Desk._** The desk has several items resting atop it: an oil lamp, a jar of ink, a quill pen, a tinderbox, and a letter kit containing a red wax candle, four blank sheets of parchment, and a wooden seal bearing the Durst family's insignia (a windmill).
There is also, more notably, a handwritten note sits atop the desk.

> [!handout]- Note from Klara
> Dear Mr. and Mrs. Durst,
> 
> In light of my current condition, I respectfully ask your leave for a brief time away from my responsibilities.
> 
> While my devotion to your dear children makes this decision difficult, I have taken it upon myself to find a solution that, I hope, will serve your household well. A good acquaintance of mine is experienced in the care of children, and I believe that she could assume my role during my temporary leave without difficulty.
> 
> I realize that my request is not without its complications. However, my years serving your family have shown me the depth of your understanding and compassion. I truly feel that I have become a part of this family, and I look forward to bringing another member of that family into this world.
> 
> Yours sincerely,
> 
> Klara
> 
> ^NoteFromKlara

The top drawer of the desk contains a number of receipts for candles, daggers, and incense.

A character that searches the room succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check can see flickering candle light emanating from beneath the secret door.

***The Secret Door.*** The secret door in this room has two components.
First, a player must pull on the switch disguised as a book (DC 13 perception check.) Doing so causes the bookshelf to swing forward, revealing a blank wooden wall behind it. Alternatively, they can play *Waltz for Klara* on the Harpsichord in the [[#Conservatory (10)]] as described [[#^00c75e|here]].

Once the bookshelf has been moved, the players can see a small panel made of dark wood behind it, built into the wall at approximately chest level. A small hollow niche, jagged and irregular, lies at the panel's centre and emanates a faint amber glow.

The door cannot be opened unless the amber shard from the Master Suite is placed into the niche. The secret door then swings open, allowing the players to enter the Secret Room.

> This small hidden room is packed with bookshelves groaning with old and ominous-looking leather-bound tomes. A heavy wooden chest with clawed iron feet stands against the south wall, its lid half-closed. Sticking out of the chest, its ribs and head caught beneath the lid, is a skeleton clad in faded bardic clothes in leather armour. An ornate lute with two of its strings snapped lies next to it covered in a thin layer of dust.

Close inspection reveals that the skeleton belongs to a Tabaxi Bard who triggered a poisoned dart trap. Three darts are stuck in the dead adventurer's armour and ribcage. The dart-firing mechanism inside the chest no longer functions.

The players may recognise the skeleton as Ugi.

Clutched in the skeleton's left hand is a letter bearing the seal of [[Strahd von Zarovich]], which the adventurer tried to remove from the chest.

> [!Handout]- Letter from [[Strahd von Zarovich]]
> My most pathetic servant,
> 
> I am not a messiah sent to you by the Dark Powers of this land. I have not come to lead you on a path to immortality. However many souls you have bled on your hidden altar, however many visitors you have tortured in your dungeon, know that you are not the one who brought me to this beautiful land. You are but a worm writhing in my earth.
> 
> You say that you are cursed, your fortune spent. Your husband took solace in the bosom of another woman, sired a bastard son, and drove you to abandon love for madness. Cursed by darkness? Of that I have no doubt. Save you from your wretchedness? I think not. I much prefer you as you are.
>

> [[Strahd von Zarovich]]

Any attempt to recall the name "[[Strahd von Zarovich]]" fail. The players will never have heard of them before.

The contents of the chest age markedly if taken from the house, but remain intact.

> [!Warning]- Design note: Removing the Deed 
> Players who find the deed to Old Bonegrinder in the secret chest often come to the mistaken conclusion that looting the deed makes them the new owners of the mill. Such players are likely, as a result, to attempt to explore the windmill during [[Arc C - Into the Valley]], triggering a conflict with the night hag coven and—through no fault of their own—a likely TPK. As such, the deed has been removed to help avoid this outcome.

> A suit of black plate armour stands against one wall, draped in cobwebs and marked by age. Oil lamps are mounted on the faded oak-panelled walls, which are carved with woodland scenes of trees, falling leaves, and tiny beasts.

The armour is an Animated Armor and attacks the moment a character comes within 5ft. 

> [!combat]- Fight against the Animated Armor

> 
> Through the dusty haze that prickles your eyes, you catch a glimpse of something through the windows: a silhouette, standing mere inches behind the glass, lit from behind by a dim, amber glow. It's still and unmoving, but the mere sight of it seizes your muscles in a vice-like grip, your limbs refusing to obey your conscious mind.
> 
> The air around you thickens, its temperature plummeting to a bone-chilling cold. Your breath fogs the glass panes, a delicate frost creeping across them as the house's distant creaks and whispers are swallowed by a heavy silence.
> 
> The shadow behind the door is nearly formless—insubstantial—but its presence invokes a primordial dread deep within your marrow. Your heart beats faster, sweat beading on your forehead, pulse racing through your veins. Slowly, the silhouette begins to turn its head toward yours.
> 
> And then, just as suddenly as it appeared, the shadow evaporates. The biting cold ebbs away, and the house's quiet sounds return once more.

Give the players a moment to react

> [!cutscene] When the players enter, read:

> 
> A door facing the foot of the bed has a faded full-length mirror mounted on it. In the right-hand corner of the room stands a small wooden door, its surface half-rotted by age. A tarnished metal button is set into the wall beside it.
> 
> A rotting tiger-skin rug lies on the floor in front of the fireplace, which has a dust-covered portrait of the man and woman from the first-floor portrait hanging above it. A web-filled parlor in the southwest corner contains two chairs and a table holding several items, as well as a door with a dark, dirt-flecked window.
> 
> The room also contains a matching pair of wardrobes, a padded chair, and a vanity with a wood-framed mirror and a silver jewelry box. A soft amber glow emanates from beneath the jewelry box's lid.

**_The Bed._** A player that approaches the bed can see that a large, bloodstained kitchen knife has been driven into one of the pillows.

**_The Jewelry Box._** The jewelry box is empty of valuables. Instead, it is filled with grain, with an _amber shard_ resting in the centre of the box. (This amber shard is the unique key to the secret door in the [[#Library (8)]].

If the player succeeds on a DC 13 Charisma (Intimidation) check, the mound must immediately use a reaction, if available, to follow the command, moving up to its speed to do so if necessary. The mound won't obey a command that is directly harmful to it, and can stop following a command at the start of its next turn.

> This dark room contains a wooden tub with clawed feet, a small iron stove with a kettle resting atop it, and a barrel under a spigot in the east wall.

A cistern on the roof used to collect rainwater, which was borne down a pipe to the spigot; however, the plumbing no longer works.
### Storage Room (14)

> [!cutscene] When the players enter, read:
> Dusty shelves line the walls of this room. A few of the shelves have folded sheets, blankets, and old bars of soap on them. A cobweb-covered broom leans against the far wall.

The cobweb-covered broom is a **broom of animated attack**. When a player first approaches within 5 feet of the **broom of animated attack**, it attacks with surprise as soon as they avert their eyes or turn away, thwacking them once upside the head. It then immediately returns to its initial position—now cobweb-free.
On its future turns, the broom uses its **_multiattack_** to continue to attack any player not looking at it who remains within 5 feet, foregoing opportunity attacks against players that move away.

### Nursemaid's Suite (15)

> [!cutscene] When the players enter, read:
> Dust and cobwebs shroud this elegantly appointed bedroom. A large bed stands against the far wall, its once-opulent coverings now faded and threadbare.
> 
> Beside the bed, a mildew-covered towel covers most of a dusty yellowed book on one of its two end tables. On the far side of the room, you can see a pair of two more stained-glass doors, their windows flecked with dirt and grime.
> 
> To the left stands an empty wardrobe, its doors slightly ajar. Mounted beside it stands a full-length mirror, its wooden frame carved to resemble ivy and berries. To the right stands a closed door.
> 
> As you look around the room, you notice that the blankets atop the bed lift slightly away from the mattress, as though something is lying atop the mattress beneath. As you watch, you can see the coverings, almost imperceptibly, slowly rise and fall with low, rhythmic rustling.

**_The Bed._** A player that removes the covers from the bed finds that there is nothing beneath them. Instead, the player only finds a bloodstained mattress and crude hand-and-foot restraints made from barbed wire nailed to the four posts of the bed frame.

**_The Doors._** A player that exits the bedroom through the stained-glass doors and onto the balcony sees only a wall of fleshy tendrils encompassing the exterior of the house. The tendrils are as described in [[#Main Hall (2a)]].

**_The Book._** The book is a cobwebbed copy of a raunchy romance novel titled _Blue-Blooded Lips_. It tells the story of a peasant woman's romance with a wealthy duke.

**_The Nursery._** The door to the nursery is closed. A player who approaches the door hears a young woman's quiet humming. (A player who has previously read or heard the song in the [[#Conservatory (10)]] recognizes the melody as _Waltz for Klara_.)

> [!cutscene] If a player enters the nursery, read:
> The air in this small nursery is strangely warm and tinged with a coppery scent. Blood-red runes cover the walls, arranged in concentric circles around the crib in the center, which seems to have a name carved into its side. Strange, flesh-like tumors have grown along the floor around it in sparse clusters, and slowly pulsate as if they're breathing.
> 
> Looking down, you notice that a small object seems to have fallen beneath the crib. In the distance, you can faintly hear the sound of an infant's soft whimpering.

The object is a severed human finger with several pieces of flesh stripped from it. Tiny toothmarks can be seen around the wounds. A DC 12 Wisdom (Medicine) check identifies the finger as a woman's, and the toothmarks as a human child's.

The name "[[Walter Durst|Walter]]" has been lovingly carved into the head of the crib. A successful DC 14 Intelligence (Arcana) identifies the runes around it as dark necromantic magic.

The crib in the centre is covered with a hanging black shroud. When characters part the shroud, they see it is empty.

**_The Mirror._** When a player approaches the mirror, the nursemaid’s spirit appears as an apparition in the glass.

The spirit resembles a pale, skeletally thin young woman, with all of her fingers and toes removed, her eyes sewn shut, and her lips and teeth torn from her mouth. Countless knife-thin scars line her entire body, including the flesh around her wrists and ankles, and her hair has been carelessly hacked to stubble.

Though its appearance is disturbing, players observing the spirit feel that it is simply observing them with shy curiosity.

The spirit can neither speak aloud nor exit the mirror. However, it shows no hostility toward the players, and can answer basic questions by nodding or shaking its head. It knows everything that the nursemaid did in life. It shows fear at any mention of Mrs. Durst’s name, sorrow at any mention of Mr. Durst's, melancholic fondness at any mention of [[Rosavalda Durst|Rose]] or [[Thornboldt Durst|Thorn]], and despair at any mention of [[Walter Durst|Walter]].

If the players ask the spirit for aid in reaching the basement or finding the “monster,” the spirit steps aside—vanishing from sight—and the secret door behind the mirror slowly swings open. The spirit does not return.

Characters who inspect the mirror notice its ornate wooden frame carved to look like ivy and berries. With a successful DC 10 Perception check, they also notice eyeballs among the berries.

## A2e. The Attic
---

### Attic Hall (16)

> [!cutscene] When the players ascend into the attic here, read:
> This bare hall is choked with dust and cobwebs. Several doors lead from this attic corridor, including a door held shut with a padlock.
> 
> A low creak cuts through the air as one of the unlocked doors slowly creaks open.

The door in question leads into the [[#Spare Bedroom (17)]].

The door to [[#Children's Room (20)]] is held shut with a padlock. Its key is kept in the [[#Spare Bedroom (17)]], but the lock can also be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.

> [!cutscene] When the players enter, read:
> This cold, dust-choked room contains a slender bed, a nightstand, a small iron stove, a writing desk with a stool, an empty wardrobe, and a rocking chair. A frowning doll in a lacy yellow dress sits in the northern window box beside a tarnished old music box, cobwebs draping it like a wedding veil.

The doll is the Yellow Doll belonging to [[Thornboldt Durst|Thorn]], as shown in [[#^600f8d|"The Durst Family" by Caleb Cleveland]].

***The Music Box.*** This contains a rusted, bloodstained skinning knife as well as the key to the padlock on [[Rosavalda Durst|Rose]] and [[Thornboldt Durst|Thorn]]'s bedroom door. It also contains two curled-up pieces of parchment.

> [!handout]- "Death House Dungeon Map" by Caleb Cleveland
> 
> The first parchment shows a basic floor plan split into three rectangles labeled QUARTERS, SHRINE, and ALTAR. QUARTERS and SHRINE are connected at the top by a single line, and at the bottom by a double line, which connects both to ALTAR.
> 
> ![[Death House Dungeon Map by Caleb Cleveland.png]]
> ^DeathHouseDungeonMap

> [!handout]- Recruitment List
> The second parchment contains a list of unfamiliar names beneath the word RECRUITMENT.
> ^RecruitmentList

As the players exit the room, the rocking chair begins to rock softly and the music box opens and begins to play. The sound of motherly humming floats through the air for two measures, but grows off-key and distorted before coming to a violent, screeching halt. The rocking chair then stops rocking.

> [!cutscene] When the players enter, read:
> This room contains a bricked-up window flanked by two dusty, wood-framed beds sized for children. Closer to the door is a toy chest with windmills painted on its sides and a dollhouse that's a perfect replica of the dreary edifice in which you stand. These furnishings are draped in cobwebs. Lying in the middle of the floor are two small skeletons wearing tattered but familiar clothing. The smaller of the two is seemingly curled into a ball next to the larger.

The toy chest contains an assortment of stuffed animals and toys.

Characters who search the dollhouse and succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check find all of the house's secret doors, including one in the attic that leads to a spiral staircase (a miniature replica of [[#Secret Stairs (21)]]).

If either the dollhouse or the chest is disturbed, the ghosts of [[Rosavalda Durst|Rose]] and [[Thornboldt Durst|Thorn]] appear in the middle of the room. At first, [[Thornboldt Durst|Thorn]] speaks up asking if the player wants to play, followed by [[Rosavalda Durst|Rose]] shushing him in hopes of protecting them. This continues until the two reveal themselves before the players. [[Rosavalda Durst|Rose]] asks the players what they're doing in the house, and the conversation leads from there.

In life, [[Rosavalda Durst|Rose]] was a budding wizard who discovered a small spellbook in her father’s library, and took great care in copying the _mending_, _light_, and _shocking grasp_ cantrips into her diary.

As the ghost children speak with the players, [[Thornboldt Durst|Thorn]] levitates one of his toys into the air, which falls and breaks. [[Rosavalda Durst|Rose]] swiftly uses her _mending_ spell to repair it. If her use of magic is remarked upon, she shyly shares her diary’s location, which can be found hidden in the cobweb-covered pillowcase on her bed.

> [!handout]- Rose Durst's Diary
> This diary, written by [[Rosavalda Durst|Rose]] in life contains the _mending_, _light_, and _shocking grasp_ cantrips.
> 
> In addition to her cantrips, Rose’s aged and faded diary also contains entries regarding her studies, her friends, her younger brother, her nursemaid (“Miss Klara”), and arguments between her mother and father. Rose doesn't know anything about the content of those fights.
> ^RoseDurstsDiary

Rose knows the way down to the basement, but “isn’t supposed to go down there.” If the party convinces her to show them the way, she points them toward the dollhouse, revealing the secret entry. In exchange, she asks the players to take her and Thorn's bones with them when they escape, burying them in the garden outside.

***The Dollhouse.*** This eerily exact replica of Death House contains small dolls that depict tiny, twisted moulds of any characters and creatures currently visible in the house. The dolls are made of painted resin. Any character looking inside the dollhouse while in Rose and Thorn’s room can see the appropriately-placed dolls of all living creatures within the manor. The dollhouse only contains rooms within the house itself, and does not depict the dungeon levels below. If the players examine the dollhouse, remove dynamic lighting and allow them to look through the house freely (NOT THE DUNGEON.)

When the secret door is revealed, Thorn shyly asks the players if he and Rose can accompany them downstairs to aid them, and attempts to possess a friendly player if permitted. When Rose or Thorn attempts to possess a player, describe it as “a child’s tiny hand, desperately seeking the touch of another soul.”

A player possessed by Rose can cast the cantrips in her diary (_mending_, _light_, and _shocking grasp_,) while a player possessed by Thorn can gain the effects of the _mage hand_ cantrip as an action, without the use of components. (The spectral hand is invisible.)

If the party is able to lay the children's spirits to rest, each character gains inspiration.
### Storage Room (18)

> [!cutscene] When the players enter, read:
> This dusty chamber is packed with lumpy, squat shapes draped in dusty white sheets. An old iron stove stands against the right-side wall, next to what looks to be a large trunk covered by a sheet.

A character who opens the trunk finds the nursemaid’s corpse, with wounds consistent with those seen on the spirit’s body in the **Nursemaid’s Suite**. A DC 14 Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals that the woman died of starvation.

A player inspecting the remains feels a cold breath on their shoulder and the unshakeable sense of being watched. Meanwhile, if another player has previously uncovered a nearby mirror from its sheet covering, that player can see an apparition of Elisabeth Durst within the mirror staring at the player near the chest. Once observed, the apparition swiftly vanishes.
### Guest Bedroom (19)

This web-filled room contains a slender bed, a nightstand, a rocking chair, an empty wardrobe, and a small iron stove.
### Secret Stairs (21)

Opening the secret door in the [[#Storage Room (18)]] reveals only a stone slab on the opposite side, inset with a small bronze panel at approximately chest level. A small hollow niche identical to the one in the library lies at the panel's center, emanating a faint amber glow. When the niche is exposed, the amber shard from the [[#Master Suite (12)]] glimmers faintly and swings in the air toward it, as though held aloft by an unseen force.

To allow the stone slab to swing open and reveal the hidden stairs on the opposite side, the players must place the amber shard into the niche.

> [!cutscene] When the players put the necklace into the niche, read:
> The secret door opens to reveal a narrow spiral staircase built of aged-looking wood within a tight shaft of mortared stone. Thick cobwebs fill the staircase as it descends into the darkness below.

Give the players a moment to respond.

> [!cutscene] As the player's descend the stairs, read:
> The broken cobwebs around you sway like a wedding veil, beckoning you forward as the ancient stairs creak and groan underfoot. The gaping maw of the stairwell draws you deeper, swallowing you up as you descend further down its gullet. You descend one floor—two floors—three.
> 
> The walls of the stone shaft narrow around you, forcing you to hunch your shoulders and pull in your elbows to continue downward. In the darkness, you can only hear the shuffle of your feet, the choking groan of the stairs, and the pounding of your blood in your ears.
> 
> Finally, after what feels like hours, the descent levels out, and the spiral staircase ends at a darkened landing of packed earth. A narrow tunnel supported by aged timber braces stretches ahead of you, its stone walls seeming to bleed with deposits of streaked, red clay. Eight feet ahead, the tunnel splits, branching to the left and right.
> 
> As your eyes and ears adjust to the cold, subterranean corridor, you notice that the tunnel isn't as silent as the staircase above. An eerie, low-pitched sound echoes through the space—and you soon recognize it as a deep, incessant chanting.

**_Milestone_**. Descending into Death House's dungeon level completes a story milestone. When the party exits the secret stairs, award each player 200 XP.

This is a good place to call Session either for a break, or until next time. Faster groups will reach this in one.

Several crypts have been hewn from the earth. Each crypt is sealed with a stone slab unless noted otherwise. Removing a slab from its fitting requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check; using a crowbar or the like grants advantage on the check.

> [!cutscene] As the players approach the [[#Empty Crypt (23a)]] and [[#Walter's Crypt (23b)]], read:
> This side-corridor branches again to the left and right. On either side, large standing stone slabs have been set aside to lean against the walls, opening the way to a pair of dark, quiet crypts. The slab to the right is etched with the name "Walter Durst"; the slab to the left is blank.

> [!cutscene] As the players approach [[#Gustav's Crypt (23c)]] and [[#Elisabeth's Crypt (23d)]], read:
> This side corridor branches again to the left and right. Large standing stone slabs seal the entrance to the tunnels on either side, blocking the way forward. The slab to the left is etched with the name "Gustav Durst"; the slab to the right is etched with the name "Elisabeth Durst." The tunnel here is unnaturally quiet, and a thin mist clings to the floor.


> [!cutscene] As the players approach [[#Rose's Crypt (23e)]] and [[#Thorn's Crypt (23f)]], read:
> This side-corridor branches again to the left and right. Large standing stone slabs seal the entrance to the tunnels on either side, blocking the way forward.

#### Empty Crypt (23a)

> [!cutscene] If the players enter the Empty Crypt, read:
> You peer past the leaning stone slab to see an empty earthen crypt.

> [!info] To Consider: [[#Empty Crypt (23a)]]
> The Empty Crypt could be replaced with a reference to the previous Curse of Strahd game. Most likely Ugi's corpse, buried in the empty crypt and starved to death.
#### Walter's Crypt (23b)

> [!cutscene] If the players enter Walter's Crypt, read:
> Swollen, bloody cysts cover the walls of this crypt like tumors. From time to time, they pulsate and burst, streams of pus oozing down to collect on the floor. Each time they do, you can hear an infant's quiet whimpers, which are swiftly quieted by the sound of distant humming.

Players who have previously read or heard the song recognize the melody of the humming as _Waltz for Klara._
#### Gustav's Crypt (23c)

> [!cutscene] If the players enter Gustav's Crypt, read:
> The crypt beyond the slab contains a stone coffin lying atop a dusty stone bier. Silence hangs heavy over the lonely chamber.

The stone coffin is empty.
#### Elisabeth's Crypt (23d)

> [!cutscene] If the players enter Elisabeth's Crypt, read:
> A thick, acrid miasma hangs over the interior of this crypt, which holds a stone-carved coffin resting atop a stone bier. The floor before it is littered with the bodies of hundreds of dead termites. Many cling to the elongated, bloated body of a dead termite queen, while others appear to have died atop the scarred, mutilated bodies of four larger beetles not far away.

The stone coffin is empty. A **Swarm of insects** boils out of the back wall and attacks if the coffin is disturbed.

The players cannot help [[Rosavalda Durst|Rose]] or [[Thornboldt Durst|Thorn]]’s ghosts find peace by placing their remains in their coffins. Neither [[Rosavalda Durst|Rose]] nor [[Thornboldt Durst|Thorn]] finds these crypts comforting. Both prefer to leave as quickly as possible.

### Cult initiates' Quarters (24)

> [!cutscene] As the players enter, read:
> A wooden table and four chairs stand at the east end of this room. To the west are four alcoves containing straw pallets. Judging by the damp look and the rancid smell, time has allowed mould to take them.

As the characters move to descend to the [[#Well and Cultist Quarters (25)]], a sudden splashing sound can be heard—which then quickly subsides.

> 
> Here, a lonely well stands at the center of the room, surrounded on three sides by several smaller, alcove-like chambers that have been carved into the walls. Old footprints criss-cross the floor, leading into the alcoves, around the well, up a staircase on the other end of the room, and back upstairs the way you came.
> 
> An old hempen rope attached to a rusted pulley descends past the mouth of the well, swaying gently in the stagnant air as if just abandoned by an unseen occupant.

The well comprises a 4-foot-diameter well shaft with a 3-foot-high stone lip, and descends 30 feet to a water-filled cistern. A wooden bucket hangs from a rope-and-pulley mechanism bolted to the cross beams above the well. The interior of the shaft is covered with an ash-black species of fungi.

If the players toss an object down the well and then turn away, they hear loud splashing and tearing sounds coming from below. When they turn back, the object has been torn to pieces, with large parts missing.

The five side rooms once served as quarters for senior cultists. Each contains a wood-framed bed with a mouldy straw mattress and a wooden chest to hold personal belongings. Each chest is secured with a rusty iron padlock that can be picked with thieves' tools and a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.
#### Room 25a

This room's chest contains 11 gp and 60 sp in a pouch made of human skin.
#### Room 25b

This room's chest contains three Moss Agates (worth 10 gp each) in a folded piece of black cloth.
#### Room 25c

This room's chest contains a black leather eyepatch with a Carnelian (worth 50 gp) sewn into it.
#### Room 25d

This room's chest contains an ivory hairbrush with silver bristles (worth 25 gp).
#### Room 25e

This room's chest contains a book bound in grimy black leather, this is [[#^DrashasCultistNotes|Drasha's Cultist Notes]].

The ghostly chanting heard throughout the dungeon gets discernibly louder as one heads west along this tunnel.

A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals and highlights an absence of footprints.

Characters searching the floor for traps find a 5-foot-long, 10-foot-deep pit hidden under several rotted wooden planks, all hidden under a thin layer of dirt.
The pit has sharpened wooden spikes at the bottom. The first character to step on the cover falls through, landing and taking 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage from the fall plus 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes.
### Dining Hall (27)

> [!cutscene] When players enter, read:
> This room contains a plain wooden table flanked by long benches. Mouldy humanoid bones lie strewn on the dirt floor. A thick stench of rot and gore fills the chamber, so coppery with blood that you can taste it on your tongue.
> 
> A few dozen mouldy bones have been piled into a grotesque and misshapen pyramid in a dark alcove to the south.

In the middle of the south wall is a [[#Larder (28)]]. Characters who approach within 5 feet of the alcove provoke the creature that lurks there.

The **grick** in this alcove—the warped remains of Gustav Durst’s flayed corpse—is coiled on the ceiling, and drops onto its victim when they enter. A DC 17 Wisdom (Perception) check allows a player to determine its presence before entering.

> [!cutscene] If the players disturb the **Grick**, read:
> A horrific creature drops from the ceiling—a long, flesh-like worm the breadth and length of a human man, its trunk resembling a humanoid body with its skin haphazardly peeled off, its arms sewn to its torso and both legs sewn together. Its flayed muscles split open to reveal a flapping, gaping maw ringed by hundreds of tiny, humanlike teeth and a gnashing, bony beak.

> [!cutscene] When players enter, read:
> This room is festooned with moldy skeletons that hang from rusty shackles against the walls, their mouths hanging open in silent screams.
> 
> A wide alcove in the south wall contains a painted wooden statue carved in the likeness of a gaunt, pale-faced man wearing a voluminous black cloak, his pale left hand resting on the head of a wolf that stands beside him. The statue's right hand holds a smoky-gray crystal orb, and its painted gaze stares down toward you, a cold and cruel glint to its eye.
> 
> Five ashen shadows are burned into the walls, with soot marks stretching across the floor toward the statue.
> 
> The room has exits to the west and north. Chanting can be heard coming from the north.

The statue depicts [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], to whom the cultists made sacrifices in the vain hope that he might reveal his darkest secrets to them.

A player that approaches the orb can hear many voices whispering the following phrases:

- “His gaze burns upon us.”
- “The Darklord’s eyes are always watching.”

Additionally, that player’s shadow begins to writhe and twist, its edges growing tattered and blurred as it lashes erratically across the floor. A player who touches the orb feels as though a “dark, ancient evil” has suddenly turned its eye upon them.

If the orb is removed from its position, the ashen **shadows** upon the walls begin to stir. Each round, up to two of the shadows “awaken,” swooping across the walls. As they awaken, they murmur and moan the following phrases:

- “Begone from this place!”
- “Look not upon us.”
- “Return the Darklord’s offering!”

Once all shadows have awoken, they attack, with each shadow preferring to target a different player. If the orb is returned to its place on the statue, the shadows return to their original positions and become dormant once more.

Characters searching the room for secret doors find a concealed door in the middle of the east wall with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. It's basically an ordinary (albeit rotted) wooden door hidden under a layer of clay. The door pulls open to reveal a stone staircase that climbs 10 feet to a landing ([[#Hidden Trapdoor (32)]])
### Hidden Trapdoor (32)

> [!cutscene] When the players find and enter, read:
> The clay staircase ends at a cramped landing. Six feet above the ground, a half-rotted ceiling of close-fitting planks holds a closed wooden trapdoor leading to an upper floor. The trapdoor is bolted shut from this side.

The trapdoor can be pushed open to reveal the [[#Den of Wolves (3)]] in the first floor of the house. Once the trapdoor has been found, it remains open.
### Cult Leader's Den (33)

> [!cutscene] When the players enter, read:
> This quiet room contains a wooden table flanked by two high-backed chairs and holding a clay jug and two flagons. Above the table is suspended an unlit cast-iron chandelier. Iron candlesticks stand in two corners of the chamber, their candles long since melted away. A short corridor at the north end of the room leads to a darkened chamber beyond.

> This room contains a large wood-framed bed, the feather mattress rotted by years of disuse. An old wooden wardrobe carved with demonic faces stands against the wall to the left, and a faded wooden footlocker stands quietly at the foot of the bed.
> 
> The room is suffused with a familiar stench of death—but far stronger, mixing with a noxious scent that fills your lungs with every breath.

The wardrobe contains several old robes, a pair of iron candlesticks, and an open crate containing thirty torches and a leather sack with fifteen candles inside it. A rotting aroma also emanates from a pair of rotted organs—a half-eaten liver and a gnawed intestine—lying hidden beneath the hems of the robes.

Folded inside the foot locker, on top of its other contents, is a **boneless** made of the recognizable flayed skin of Gustav Durst (Removed from his corpse found in [[#Larder (28)]]). When the foot locker is opened, the **boneless** springs out to attack the nearest creature.

Characters searching the footlocker, beneath the **boneless** find a folded cloak of protection, a small wooden coffer (unlocked) containing four potions of healing, a chain shirt, a mess kit, a flask of alchemist's fire, a bullseye lantern, a set of thieves' tools, and a spellbook with a yellow leather cover.

These items were taken from adventurers who were drawn into Barovia, captured, and killed by the cult.

### Reliquary (35)

> [!cutscene] When the players enter, read:
> The dusty stone steps descend past a landing and around a bend until they end at a cold, rectangular chamber. A thin, wafting mist clings to the ground, and the wooden cross beams that support the ceiling groan beneath the weight of the house and underground complex above.
> 
> The walls of this room are cut with small, chiseled alcoves, each holding a strange, ghastly trinket or relic. A corridor with a sagging ceiling exits the chamber and bends out of sight to the right. Past it, you can see a stone slope that descends into black, murky water. The ghostly chant you've heard since entering the basement is strongest here, and seems to be emanating from the other side of a rusted, closed portcullis.
> 
> You can finally understand the words.
> 
> They say, over and over again, in a ceaseless refrain:
> 
> "He is the Ancient."
> 
> "He is the Land."

The cult amassed several "relics" that it used in its rituals. These worthless items are stored in thirteen niches along the walls:

- A small, mummified, yellow hand with sharp claws (a goblin's hand) on a loop of rope
- A knife carved from a human bone
- A dagger with a rat's skull set into the pommel
- An 8-inch-diameter varnished orb made from a nothic's eye
- An aspergillum carved from bone
- A folded cloak made from stitched ghoul skin
- A desiccated frog lashed to a stick (could be mistaken for a wand of polymorph)
- A bag full of bat guano
- A hag's severed finger
- A 6-inch-tall wooden figurine of a mummy, its arms crossed over its chest
- An iron pendant adorned with a devil's face
- The shrunken, shrivelled head of a halfling
- A small wooden coffer containing a dire wolf's withered tongue

The southernmost tunnel slopes down at a 20-degree angle into murky water and ends at a rusty portcullis [[#Portcullis (27)]].

***Secret Door.*** A secret door in the south wall can be found with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check and pulls open to reveal [[#Ritual Chamber (38)]] beyond.

Hanging on the back wall of the cell marked X on the GM layer is a human skeleton clad in a tattered black robe. The skeleton belongs to a cult member who questioned the cult's blind devotion to [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]. Characters who search the skeleton find a gold ring (worth 25 gp) on one of its bony fingers. ^GoldRing
### Portcullis (37)

> [!cutscene] When the players approach this area, read:
> The floor is submerged beneath two feet of dark, murky water that sloshes around your calves and boots. The tunnel forward is blocked by a rusty iron portcullis. Beyond its iron bars, you can make out the dark outline of a half-submerged chamber, a raised stone dais, and a thick cloud of rolling mist.

The wooden wheel that opens the portcullis remains on the western side of the gate (i.e., the side facing the [[#Ritual Chamber (38)]]. However, the chain-link mechanism to open the portcullis has broken, preventing the players from proceeding without repairing it (e.g., by using Rose’s _mending_ cantrip) or lifting the portcullis by hand. (If the players lift the portcullis by hand and then release it, its weight causes it to shut once more unless propped open.)

The water is 2ft deep and is difficult terrain for Medium creatures or smaller. Climbing from the pool to the ledges also counts as difficult terrain.

> [!cutscene] When the players enter, read:
> The smooth masonry walls of this forty-foot-square room provide excellent acoustics. Featureless stone pillars support the ceiling, and murky water covers most of the floor. Stairs lead up to dry stone ledges that hug the walls. In the middle of the room, more stairs rise to form an octagonal dais that also rises above the water. Rusty chains with shackles dangle from the ceiling directly above a stone altar mounted on the dais. The altar is carved with hideous depictions of grasping ghouls and is stained with dry blood. A small, white bundle lies atop it, surrounded by pulsating, fleshy tendrils.
> 
> The tendrils run to a breach in the far wall that leads to a dark cave, their fleshy masses connecting to a dark, hulking shadow that lies within, its bloated mass rising and falling with a slow, shuddering rhythm.
> 
> As soon as you step foot into the chamber, the ghostly chanting you've heard suddenly falls silent.

A player that approaches the altar sees that the words "FEED HIM" are carved into its flat stone surface just below the white bundle, surrounded by several fleshy tendrils inset with human teeth. The tendrils belong to the **flesh mound** (see below).

The bundle atop the altar is the size and shape of an infant wrapped in swaddling clothes. If unwrapped, the players instead find it to hold a rusted, serrated dagger stained red with ancient blood.

The dark shadow in the cave is a **flesh mound** containing Walter’s spirit and remains. It is a swollen, bloated mound of bones, flesh, and gore that seems to breathe as its mass rises and falls. A player that observes it concludes that it appears to be sleeping.

The cultists' shadows described in “One Must Die!” (p. 220) do not appear when a player climbs the altar. Instead, the players have two choices: sacrifice a living creature on the altar, or attack the flesh mound.

If a creature is sacrificed on the altar, the flesh mound's tendrils accept its corpse and pull it to the mound's lair. There, the mound messily devours it before returning its tendrils to the altar once more. Feeding the mound does not free the players, because its hunger cannot be sated.

The flesh mound awakens if it or its tendrils are attacked, or at midnight. When it does, its subsequent screeching wail causes the earth to tremble, sending the [[#Portcullis (27)]] crashing to the ground if it's been opened and damaging the mechanism responsible for opening it.

> [!warning]- Don't Use Tactics!
> All enemies in this guide, including boss monsters, have been exhaustively playtested and balanced using the Challenge Ratings 2.0 encounter-building system. All major boss encounters, including the two-phase fight with the **flesh mound**, have been calibrated to consume most or all of the players' hit points, in order to create a dangerous and exciting fight.
> 
> However, these boss statblocks have enough hit points and deal enough damage per round (DPR) to ensure that they can present a suitable threat without any special tactics or strategy. To the extent any such strategies exist, they have been built into the statblock and require no additional strategizing by the Dungeon Master.
> 
> Accordingly, unless your players have proven themselves highly tactical and/or optimized, **avoid playing these boss statblocks tactically**—because if you _do_ play them tactically, you're very likely to TPK your players. Instead, simply choose whichever actions, bonus actions, reactions, and targets will provide the most interest and excitement for the current round.

> [!combat]- Fighting the Flesh Mound (Boss Stage 1)
> In combat, the flesh mound begins in its first form, **the flesh mound**. For one minute after it has awoken, the flesh mound’s **_heavy sleeper_** feature reduces the power of its **_multiattack_** actions in either form.

For parties of smaller or larger sizes, modify the encounter as follows:

> When **the flesh mound** drops to 0 hit points, it expels each creature currently engulfed by it. (Those creatures appear prone in an empty space within 5 feet of the mound.) The mound’s statistics are then instantly replaced by the statistics of its second form, **Walter, the Graveborn**. Its initiative count doesn’t change. Excess damage doesn't carry over to its new form, but it retains any conditions it had in its previous form. For one minute after it has awoken, Walter, the Graveborn’s **_heavy sleeper_** feature reduces the power of its **_multiattack_** actions.

If the player succeeds on a DC 13 Charisma (Intimidation) check, the mound must immediately use a reaction, if available, to follow the command, moving up to its speed to do so if necessary. The mound won't obey a command that is directly harmful to it, and can stop following a command at the start of its next turn.

## A2h. Escape From Death House
---
When the **flesh mound** dies, the players can hear the sound of the house’s front door opening far overhead, and the distant thunderstorm beyond.

Give the players a chance to breath after the fight, mainly mention the remains of Walter Durst sitting within the corpse of the Flesh Mound, the whimpering now quiet and distant.

If the players ask [[Rosavalda Durst|Rose]] or [[Thornboldt Durst|Thorn]] what they should do, [[Rosavalda Durst|Rose]] mentions "While we never really got to meet him, Walter is still our brother. He deserves rest."

> [!cutscene] When the players next begin to move towards the exit, read:
> A guttural moan ripples through the air—and a terrifying apparition manifests before you: the spirit of Elisabeth Durst, her once-beautiful features now grotesquely distorted. Her lustrous hair is a wild, disheveled mess, her skin a deathly pallor, and her lips peeling back to reveal sharp, yellowed teeth. An amber shard glows ominously on a cord around her spectral neck, a shadowed wisp swirling within its depths.
> 
> The spirit levitates high above the floor, sunken eyes blazing with malice and mouth twisted into a snarl. "You may have evaded my pet," it rasps, "but I will tear this house apart before I let you escape." It throws its head back and lets loose a blood-curdling scream that reverberates across the stone walls—and sets the very foundations of the house trembling.
> 
> Far above, the grandfather clock begins to chime, the sound mounting to a thunderous cacophony. Dust and debris rain down as the floor shakes beneath you, the wooden cross beams of the ceiling starting to splinter and crack. Elisabeth's spirit fixes you with a feral grin—and then dissipates into thin air, leaving only echoes of its spiteful laughter as the house rumbles, shifts, and groans.

The players must flee from the ritual chamber to the [[#Entrance (1)]] of Death House before the entire structure collapses upon their heads. However, they don't need to roll initiative.

As the players escape the crumbling Death House, they face three additional obstacles:

#### Obstacle 1 - Gustav's Ghost.
As the players move to exit the [[#Reliquary (35)]], the ghost of Gustav Durst confronts them.

> [!cutscene] When it does, read:
> An ethereal apparition appears before you, obstructing the stairs—the ghost of a man. He is a gaunt and pale figure, with sunken, haunted eyes and trembling hands, wearing once-fine clothing now tattered with age.
> 
> "Please," the spirit says, tears beading at the corners of his eyes. "You have to stay here and die. She won't accept anything else."

The spirit is recognizable as Gustav Durst. Gustav pleads with the players to give up, insisting that Elisabeth's spirit is simply too powerful—too fearsome—to disobey. A DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that Gustav is terrified of Elisabeth—and ridden with guilt, doubt, and self-loathing.

If the players attempt to bypass or attack Gustav, a swarm of levitating debris and shrapnel arises around him. He pleads with the players again, insisting that he doesn't want to fight them, but that he doesn't know that he has any other choice.

> [!combat]- Fight Against the Poltergeist
> Gustav Durst's ghost uses the statistics of a **poltergeist**, but without its **_invisibility_** feature.
> 
> This combat encounter is a **bruising** encounter against a party of five 2nd-level players, and will consume approximately 28% of their total maximum hit points. For parties of smaller or larger sizes, modify the encounter as follows:
>
>- **_Three Players._** Reduce Gustav’s hit points to 13. Reduce his **_forceful slam_** attack to 6 (3d4-1) force damage and his **_telekinetic thrust_** action’s attack to 3 (1d6) bludgeoning damage.
>- **_Four Players._** Reduce Gustav’s hit points to 18. Reduce his forceful slam attack to 8 (3d4+1) **_force damage_** and his **_telekinetic thrust_** action’s attack to 4 (1d8) bludgeoning damage.
>- **_Six Players._** Increase Gustav’s hit points to 26. Increase his **_forceful slam_** attack to 12 (3d6+2) force damage and his **_telekinetic thrust_** action’s attack to 6 (1d12) bludgeoning damage.
>
>```statblock
>creature: Poltergeist
>``` 
>
>The players can convince Gustav to step aside with a successful DC 20 Charisma (Intimidation) check. Alternatively, if the players reference Gustav's history with Elisabeth and Klara, they can convince him to stand aside with a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check, succeeding automatically if they show him empathy or kindness or if they ask Rose and Thorn's spirits to assist them in their plea.
>
>If the players successfully persuade Gustav to stand aside, he warns them that "her other servants" are lying in wait ahead to block the players' escape. "Don't fear them," he says. "Their only power is fear." He then vanishes.
#### Obstacle 2 - The Cult's Return.
When the players first reach the [[#Family Crypts (23)]] or (if they have previously found and opened the hidden trapdoor described in [[#Hidden Trapdoor (32)]]) near the [[#Darklord's Shrine (31)]], the spirits of the cult arise to stop them.

> [!cutscene] When they do, read:
> The chanting rises once more as thirteen dark apparitions appear around you, obstructing the way forward—as well as the way back. Each one resembles a black-robed figure holding a torch, but the torch's fire is black and seems to draw light into it. Where you'd expect to see faces are voids. "He is the Ancient!" they chant, over and over. "He is the Land!"

The apparitions are harmless and intangible figments that can't be damaged, turned, or dispelled. At the end of each round, each player that remains between the apparitions must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 2 (1d4) bludgeoning damage from falling debris.

If there are only three players, reduce the damage per round to 1 bludgeoning only.
#### Obstacle 3 - Elisabeth's Grasp.
When the players reach the [[#Storage Room (18)]] via the [[#Secret Stairs (21)]], or the [[#Den of Wolves (3)]] via the [[#Hidden Trapdoor (32)]], Elisabeth attempts to reclaim them below ground by grasping hold of them and thrusting them through the floor.

> [!combat]- Escape from Elisabeth's Grasp
> Once per round, Elisabeth Durst manifests a spindly elongated claw, using the Stats of **Elisabeth's Claw**, reaching from beneath the house through the chimneys. It emerges from any hearth or bursts from closed chimney sections (smashing the brick in the process,) before reaching out towards the closest player.

# A3. Outside Death House
When the players exit Death House, the storm overhead has slowed to a mere drizzle, and the mists around the house have disappeared. Night has long since fallen, and the waning moon is high in the sky.

Most surprisingly, the players now find themselves in a dark forest clearing at the beginning of the [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia#B1. Old Svalich Roach|B1. Old Svalich Road]], rather than in the streets of Greyhallow or Daggerford. The road travels west. To the east lie dark, endless woods filled with the [[Mists of Ravenloft]].

The house then collapses into the earth, leaving a dark and bottomless pit behind. If the players still have it, [[#^ElisabethsAmberNecklace|Elisabeth's Amber Shard Necklace]] then crumbles into dust. The pit vanishes the first time the players depart the clearing.

If they’re still possessing the players, [[Rosavalda Durst|Rose]] and [[Thornboldt Durst|Thorn]]’s spirits end their possessions. The children remark that the woods resembles the [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia#B3. Svalich Woods|B3. Svalich Woods]], which once surrounded their home—[[The Village of Barovia|Barovia]]. However, the children add that these particular woods are unfamiliar to them, and that they seem to be far from their family's original village.

As the players explore their surroundings, they can quickly see the top of an old, ruined stone tower poking up through the treetops. (This is a reference to the Will o' Wisp random encounter.)

> [!cutscene] If the characters approach the tower, read:
> You come upon the shell of a ruined tower. The upper floors of the structure have collapsed, leaving heaps of rubble and shattered timber around the tower's base. However upon closer inspection, it appears as though the roof of the lower levels remain intact, fighting back the rain and wind. A calm quiet rests upon its stone.

Give the players a chance to react.

> [!cutscene] If the players enter the tower, read:
> The floor of the tower is made of packed earth. Built into the inside walls of the tower, small window slits allow a view of the dreary outside.

The players can easily surmise that this ruin appears to be a safe place to spend the night. [[Rosavalda Durst|Rose]] and [[Thornboldt Durst|Thorn]] offer to serve as sentries while the players rest, watching the woods and awakening the players should any threats emerge.

The night passes without issue. When the players awaken the following morning, [[Rosavalda Durst|Rose]] and [[Thornboldt Durst|Thorn]] ask the players if they can bury their remains before proceeding any further, so that they can finally rest. (The children's spirits will not proceed further into Barovia, instead pleading for the players to allow them to rest.) If the players bury their remains here, the children’s spirits thank them before vanishing.

If the players bury Walter's bones, Walter's infant spirit appears with the children. Death House also ceases searching for sacrifices beyond the mist, forever putting the house to rest.
If Klara's bones were laid to rest along with Walter's, she appears with a tear in her eye, cradling Walter's Spirit while humming *Waltz for Klara*. She thanks the players, promising to look after the children in the afterlife. She vanishes along with the children.

The players can find the beginning of the [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia#B1. Old Svalich Roach|B1. Old Svalich Road]] a short ways through the woods away from the tower. [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia]] then begins.

**_Milestone_**. Escaping Death House completes a story milestone. When the party begins their first long rest after escaping the house, award each player 400 XP. (This should allow the players to advance to 3rd level.)
# Design Notes: Death House

## Familiar Friend
---
Should a player plan on taking a familiar, there is a potential for it to appear within the house as a ghost, which can then later be summoned as an ally.
In an attempt to keep the familiar's form as open ended as possible, have then appear in random places in the house, guiding the players through it subtly if they get stuck (For example, having a player briefly sight the familiar in its ghostly form before it flickers away towards the next plot point.)
## An Altruistic Search
---
Should a player be looking for a particular person, as per the [[Getting Started#Lost in the Mists|Lost in the Mists]] [[Getting Started#Adventure Hooks|Adventure Hook]], they could have potentially been taken by Death House into Barovia. Depending on who they are and why they're searching for them, employ any of the following:
- The missing person was killed in Death House, the half eaten remains of their body found splayed out, floating just beneath the surface of the murky water in the [[#Ritual Chamber (38)]].
- The missing person was entombed alive inside the [[#A2f. The Basement]] portion of Death House, found in the [[#Empty Crypt (23a)]] starved half to death.
- The missing person escaped Death House, but left something behind in the [[#Ritual Chamber (38)]] as a clue to their whereabouts or survival (for example, their weapon, a scarf, or a hastily written note.) The person can then be found in [[The Village of Barovia]], perhaps at [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia#B5c. The Blood of the Vine Tavern (E2)|The Blood of the Vine Tavern]] having fended off the previous nights attack by the undead (See [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia#B5. The Village of Barovia (E)]])
- The missing person is roaming free inside the [[#A2f. The Basement]] portion of Death House, found in any room lacking a combat encounter, or attempting to fight off the [[#^FightAgainstTheGrick|Grick]] in the [[#Larder (28)]].
# Campaign Variation Notes
## Into Mists
---
### Who's Lancelot?
During the cult's most active years, a young woman was indoctrinated into their ranks, known as [[Aneta Dragomira]]. She was remarkably antisocial, and often outcast from other circles, making her a prime target for the cult's recruitment effort; but with her, came [[Ambrose]], her Salpurr companion.
Salpurr's are well-known for their ability to see someone's true colours. When they find someone that they consider to be a good person at heart, they will often become wholly attached to them and stick around, becoming something similar to a familiar. (What a Salpurr considers to be a good person is entirely based on their own morals, meaning a Salpurr companion is not necessarily a sign of a good person.)
What is lesser known however is, should the heart of a Salpurr's friend become clouded with quality's the Salpurr finds unsavoury, the Salpurr will remain, attempting to subtly guide that person back to the right path. Only when the Salpurr believes that guiding the person back to the right path is an impossible act, will they abandon.

After [[Aneta Dragomira|Aneta]] joined the cult and [[Ambrose]] remained, they took it as a sign that their work was just and good, although it wasn't long before [[Aneta Dragomira|Aneta]] questioned this.
Every day or so [[Ambrose]] would subtly make [[Aneta Dragomira|Aneta]] question her dedication and morals. 

Some days, [[Ambrose]] would lead [[Aneta Dragomira|Aneta]] to the stripped corpses of the cult's victims, while others they would interrupt [[Aneta Dragomira|Aneta]] while she was performing tasks for the cult. Each time, [[Aneta Dragomira|Aneta]]'s devotion wavered, but it was never enough to break it.

After Elisabeth Durst locked her children away on the fourth floor, [[Ambrose]] began attempting to guide [[Aneta Dragomira|Aneta]] to the children's bedroom to get her to free them.
Eventually, [[Ambrose]] was successful, getting [[Aneta Dragomira|Aneta]] to truly question and eventually reject their devotion to Strahd and the Cult.

The two were caught by Drasha while trying to pick the lock into the Children's Bedroom.

On Drasha's orders [[Aneta Dragomira|Aneta]] was imprisoned beneath the house, the cult removing one of her lungs while keeping her alive to feel it. They would eventually cook it and force her to eat it, calling the dish a "Breath Cake."
When this did not break her spirit, Drasha herself had [[Ambrose]] butchered in front of [[Aneta Dragomira|Aneta]] before forcing her to eat the Salpurr's corpse. This had the desired effect, and [[Aneta Dragomira|Aneta]] completely crumbled into a blabbering mess.

[[Aneta Dragomira|Aneta]] died in shackles in the [[#Prison (36)]], a husk of her former self.

Centuries later, [[Ambrose]] roams the Durst manor as a spirit, determined to stop the cult from claiming any more good people. After the cult is stopped, and Durst Manor is put to rest, [[Ambrose]] will stick with the players in spirit form, becoming an available summon via the Find Familiar spell. 
[[Ambrose]]'s goal becomes to do for the players what she failed to do for [[Aneta Dragomira|Aneta]], help them escape their captor.

[[Valeria]] finds herself able to communicate with [[Ambrose]], treating her like a lost spirit. It's [[Valeria]] that [[Ambrose]] approaches first, finding her traits and fate strikingly similar to [[Aneta Dragomira|Aneta]]'s. First guiding her through the house, [[Ambrose]] eventually interacts with [[Valeria]] by the [[#Darklord's Shrine (31)]], where she tries to warn against taking the Crystal Ball (she does this by standing between [[Valeria]] and the statue.) From there, they will remain visible and lead the group to the prison, and [[Aneta Dragomira|Aneta]]'s corpse, hoping they can bury her too. 
While like this, only [[Valeria]] can see [[Ambrose]].
### The Missing Squires
As detailed in [[#An Altruistic Search]] above, [[Meowth]] and [[James]] have gone missing, swept up by Death House on the eve of Harvesttide. When the party go to search for them, they too are swept up by the house, trapped inside.

After being sent out of the [[#A1a. The Wanking Goblin]] in search of a place to stay, the two stumbled across a seemingly empty house. The pair knocked at the front, the door mysteriously opening for them, and the two entered only to be trapped inside.

The two explored Death House for a time, stumbling their way through its dangers.
[[Meowth]] found the [[#Dining Room (5)]] and swiftly began partaking in the seemingly infinite feast, while [[James]], determined to make [[Sir Gus Gus|Sir Gus]] proud, scouted on ahead.

[[James]] had made it to the third floor, and [[Meowth]] his third course, before the players arrived. Determined not to give up her sacrifices so easy, Elisabeth possessed [[James]], knocked him out, and trapped him within the [[#^DHFightAgainstTheAnimatedArmor|Animated Armor]] on the [[#Balcony (11)]].
After, she made sure to drag [[Meowth]] through the floors in the Basement (foreshadowing her desperate grasping in [[#Obstacle 3 - Elisabeth's Grasp.]]), burying him alive in the [[#Empty Crypt (23a)]]. 

When the party find [[Meowth]], he is scared, traumatised, and hungry in the [[#Empty Crypt (23a)]]. Although he has only been buried here for less than a few hours, he looks like he hasn't slept in days. Upon being found, he happily re-joins the group, but refuses to fight. 

After the party defeated the Animated Armor, [[James]], who's head barely reaches the armour's chest height, slowly came back to consciousness. It was only after the party had made their way into the Dungeon however, that they were able to get out of the armour and back onto their feet.

Heading back down to the [[#Dining Room (5)]], [[James]] was shocked and horrified to find [[Meowth]] missing. At this point, the players defeat the [[Walter Durst|Flesh Mound]], the doors to the house bursting open.
Elisabeth's Grasps desperately attempts to grab hold of [[James]], but he avoids it. Mortally terrified, in an act of cowardice he will never forgive himself for, [[James]] then flees Death House.
He runs so far and so fast, that only when he begins to see [[The Village of Barovia]] on the horizon does [[James]] notice that he isn't in Eiraya anymore and that something is incredibly wrong. 

As he approaches the settlement, undead emerge from the treeline and attack.
[[James]] flees, banging on the [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia#B5a. The Barricade|The Barricade]] to be let in through the gates while the undead hordes of night swarming behind them. [[Parriwimple]], defending the line with his uncle [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]], hoists him up with his incredible strength to safety against [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]]'s wishes.

Injured, afraid, and confused [[James]] was guided by [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], who found him while delivering fresh supplies to [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia#B5f. The Eastern Barricade|the Eastern Barricade]], to shelter with the other [[Barovians]] in the [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia#B5b. Town Square|Town Square]]. There, he met [[Gertruda]] who explained his situation to him, while fascinated over finally meeting an outsider. Believing himself to be alone and trapped in Barovia, [[James]] falsely introduced himself as an injured Knight-Lord by the name of Sir Gus Gus, using the real [[Sir Gus Gus]]'s Shield as proof of station. Relieved by the appearance of a hero, [[Gertruda]] confided in him regarding [[Doru]]'s rebellion and her plan to secretly leave [[the Village of Barovia]] for [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] in the morning, inviting him along on the journey to help save the village.
While terrified, [[James]] believes that what Barovia needs is not him, but [[Sir Gus Gus]], and that this would be his first test of values. He agreed to go, lifting a pitchfork from a dead commoner as his weapon, and holding close [[Sir Gus Gus]]'s Shield as his protection. The morning before the players arrive in [[The Village of Barovia]], the [[James]] and [[Gertruda]] set out for [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], where they would encounter [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] together as detailed in [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia#^WheresGertruda|Where's Gertruda]].

[[James]] initially attempted to stand up to the [[Strahd von Zarovich|Devil]], but after [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] revealed his Vampiric Nature, [[James]] found himself unable to do anything but watch as the interaction between [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] and [[Gertruda]] took place. Afterwards [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], who saw through [[James]]' lie and found him a pathetic whelp unworthy of his attention, granted his permission for his Dire wolves to feast. In a blind panic, [[James]] fled up the northwest fork of the crossroads towards [[Arc C - Into the Valley#C4. Tser Pool (G)|the Tser Pool encampment]] before hiding up a tree to escape them.
Hours passed in silent fear before he was discovered by [[Arturi Radanavich]], who was journeying to [[Arc C - Into the Valley#C4. Tser Pool (G)|the Tser Pool encampment]]. [[Arturi Radanavich|Arturi]] sympathised with [[James]]' predicament and bid him accompany him to the encampment, which [[James]], still posing as [[Sir Gus Gus]], gladly did.

After meeting the Vistani there and accepting their hospitality, Madame Eva advised him stay the night, but to make his way to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] before daybreak to avoid [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], who she sensed would visit the following morning. She told him that in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], [[James]] would find folks in need of protection. "By dedicating yourself to their protection, you will find the path you desire."
Come early morning, [[James]] began his journey to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]].
### The Living Scarf
Unbeknownst to [[Stumpfoot]], the Scarf around his neck has a sense of pseudo-sentiency (think the flying carpet from Aladdin.)

The scarf is originally a Vistani Raunie Scarf, given as a gift to Vistana that split from a Caravan to signify that they're creating their own. This scarf is then kept by the Vistana, who becomes the Caravan's Raunie. Raunie Scarf's are typically passed down to new elders over generations, with each Raunie weaving their own coloured thread into the scarf.
Each Vistani Caravan will have an Raunie Scarf. The more intricate the design is, the older and typically more established that caravan is.

The Vistani Raunie Scarf that [[Stumpfoot]] possesses was a gift from the Raunie of the Radanavich Caravan at the time, to a Vistana known as Beatrice Radanavich, a Bard with the gift of a Vistani Seer.
Despite not being directly involved with it, Beatrice had always loathed her family's alliance with Baron Metus, who she viewed as a vile monster, but loyalty to her Caravan and Raunie, Madame Irene Radanavich, prevented her from taking action.
However when Beatrice awakened to her Seer power, she knew the rest of the Caravan would force her hand to participate in the Baron's plans and worse, would never let her leave. And so she hid her nature, eventually leaving the Radanavich's to forge her own Caravan.
She established the Caravan name Radanya, before joining Wizwail's Carnival of Cryptoids & Quacks as "Madame Radanya, the Siren Songstress."
Specializing in Musical & Storytelling Performances, Madame Radanya became well known in her field for being a master of the macabre both in the tales she told and in the instruments she mastered.

After finding [[Stumpfoot]] and taking him in, Madame Radanya performed the Blood Rite with him to make him a Radanya, although due to his age at the time [[Stumpfoot]] doesn't remember. It was at this point that [[Stumpfoot]] inherited the blood of a Vistani Seer.
She then began raising him, teaching him whatever he needed to know.

After [[Stumpfoot]] had been travelling with the Carnival for some time, the group stopped in a backwater village preparing the perform. The first evening they were there, the undead rose from their graves and began attacking the village to get to the Carnival. Unbeknownst to [[Stumpfoot]], the undead were desperately trying to get to Madame Radanya to complete the curse put on her family blood the previous night (see [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten]]'s Curse on the Radanavich's.)
Many were killed, and the village blamed the Carnival, marching on it and hanging all its members from the Witch Elm.
When Madame Radanya finally took her last breath she passed her soul into her Vistani Raunie Scarf, after which it flowed over to the last member of the Radanya family, [[Stumpfoot]].

Watching the slow death of his mentor awoke something deep in [[Stumpfoot]], the Vistani See Blood within him, bestowing him a fraction of her Foresight.

Lead [[Stumpfoot]] to believe that the Scarf allows him to glimpse into the future via prophecies in his dreams, then reveal the Scarf's true nature along with [[Stumpfoot]]'s inheritance.
