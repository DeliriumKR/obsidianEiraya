## Recap
---
After burying the bones of the Children, Klara, and Walter, the party begin their journey down the long road leading beyond the tower. With mists spilling behind them, they soon find the woods around them closing in, hungering for their sense of direction.

After some time, the group found themselves before a towering gate that opened mysteriously to greet them, and as they passed under its arch, [[Sir Gus Gus|Sir Gus]] discovered what he believed to be the footprints of his lost companion James darting through the sodden ground at high speeds. 

Proceeding further, the group discovered a rotting corpse at the edge of the path holding a compass, seemingly perishing from exhaustion. A tree nearby pointed across the road to an opening and, through curiosity, the party followed to investigate. After coming upon a horse who had met a similar fate. Trees along the path pointed further until their path vanished into the wall of mists. [[Stumpfoot]] was the first to brave the mists, followed by the others. After a short period of time, they all found themselves emerging from the wall of mist in an unfamiliar part of the woods. It wouldn't be long before they discovered they had looped on themselves, perhaps in the same way the corpse had.
Steeling their resolve, they continued down the road further.

Eventually, the group reached a run-down village, boarded up with ruined barricades and defences, where they met Ismark Kolyanovich, the Burgomaster's son. Inviting the party inside, he welcomed them to a drink at the Blood of the Vine Tavern. 
There, he explained to the group the following:

They have entered the land of Barovia, a realm surrounded by [[Mists of Ravenloft|deadly fog]] and ruled by [[Strahd von Zarovich]], a powerful vampire who slumbered in [[Castle Ravenloft]] until recently.

Just over three months ago, a man named [[Doru]], the son of the [[Father Donavich|village priest]], raised a rebellion against the [[Castle Ravenloft|castle]], hoping to free the valley from its prison in [[Mists of Ravenloft|the mists]]. Their revolt failed, awakening [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] from his dormancy and spurring the vampire to vow vengeance upon the village below. None of the revolutionary's returned.

A few days later, a dusk-skinned elf came to the village and announced that the village had ninety days to make peace with the gods before the lord of [[Castle Ravenloft]]—now awoken after a hundred years of slumber—exacted penance for their disobedience.

Several dozen [[Barovians]] fled to [[the town of Vallaki]], almost a day’s travel to the west. The remainder stayed in the village following rousing words from Ismark inspiring them, determined to defend their homes and those who were unable to make the journey.

Six nights ago, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s undead forces began attacking the town. Each night, the [[Barovians]] beat back multiple waves of the dead—and each night, the horde comes ever-closer to breaching the village’s defences.
Many [[Barovians]] fear that the village is doomed. The undead have infested the woods to the north, west, and south, blocking the [[#B1. Old Svalich Road (A)]] just past the Ivlis River. With [[Mists of Ravenloft|the Mists]] blocking passage to the east, the village has been effectively cut off from the world, left to survive on its own—or perish.

From a table over, a rugged man hunched in figure and spite in his eyes, spoke up, enraged by Ismark's words. The man was Bildrath, a bitter man who has lost most of his family to the besieging undead. He advised the party to stay well away from "Ismark the Lesser," lest they wind up dead, then rising to join the horde that oppressed them. 

At this moment, a woman who Ismark addressed as Mary, burst into the Tavern with tears in her eyes. She pleaded that her daughter had gone missing that morning.
"Master Kolyanovich—I apologize for interrupting you and your guests. But I haven't seen Gertruda since last night, nor that outsider Sir Gus she met yesterday, and Nori isn't in the stable. I think that knight and Gertruda have left for Vallaki—alone."
## Next Session Intro

In the dead silence of the Tavern after Bildrath and Mary have both left, Ismark turns to our adventurers with a worry in his eyes.

“It is getting dark, I imagine it won't be long until the undead try their hand at our throats again. Like it or not, we’re all in this together," he says sombrely. “I know you have only just arrived, but you look more than capable of fighting off the dead, no? The more hands, the better. I don’t know if I can promise coin, but I can promise it’ll help all of us survive the night—yourselves included. Please, will you help me and my people?"

As the silence slowly erodes and quiet conversation between the tavern's denizens take its place, the stage returns to you, and you find yourself in-character once more.
