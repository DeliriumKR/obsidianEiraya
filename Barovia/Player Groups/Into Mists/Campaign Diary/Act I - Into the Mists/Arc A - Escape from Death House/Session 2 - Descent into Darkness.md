## Recap

After concluding their fight with the Animated Armor, the group made their way towards the Storage Room, getting into a domestic with an Animated Broom about their small collection of Gold Coins. After this altercation, [[Stumpfoot]] made his way towards the Master Bedroom. Feeling the presence of Elizabeth Durst, the group cautiously proceeded inside to discover a note from Elizabeth Durst to a cultist called Drasha mentioning the monster in the basement and how they keep it under control. They also discovered a small Amber Shard that once belonged to Elizabeth.

After further exploration of the house, [[Scarlet]] raised concerns that while the house was 4 stories tall, they had only encountered access to 3. The group returned to the Nursemaid suite and expressed this to Klara, who gave them directions to a secret area behind the mirror that would to the 4th attic floor.

Ascending, the group ventured out into the larger attic storage room, finding the body Klara, the nursemaid, in a sorry state. Then in one of the spare bedrooms, they found a note detailing a cult base beneath the house, and a key leading into the Children's bedroom.

Entering the children's room, they discovered the two child size corpses or Rose and Thorn Durst. Their apparitions quickly made themselves known, questioning the adventurers and their motives before eventually agreeing to help them find the basement in exchange for helping them to achieve closure by burying their bones. Additionally, they requested to be able to join the party by possessing two of them, and while initially it was [[Valeria]] and [[Sir Gus Gus|Sir Gus]] that the children chose, after a scare Rose and Thorn instead chose to reside in [[Valeria]] and [[Scarlet]] for the remainder of the adventure.

Standing on the precipice of the Basement stairs, the group began to descend...

Moving into the dungeon beneath Death House, the group also earnt 200xp.
## Next Session Intro
---
As  the group descends into the beckoning dark below, the stage returns to you, and you find yourself in-character once more.

The broken cobwebs around you sway like a wedding veil, beckoning you forward as the ancient stairs creak and groan underfoot. The gaping maw of the stairwell draws you deeper, swallowing you up as you descend further down its gullet. You descend one floor—two floors—three.

The walls of the stone shaft narrow around you, forcing you to hunch your shoulders and pull in your elbows to continue downward. In the darkness, you can only hear the shuffle of your feet, the choking groan of the stairs, and the pounding of your blood in your ears.
 
Finally, after what feels like hours, the descent levels out, and the spiral staircase ends at a darkened landing of packed earth. A narrow tunnel supported by aged timber braces stretches ahead of you, its stone walls seeming to bleed with deposits of streaked, red clay. Eight feet ahead, the tunnel splits, branching to the left and right.

As your eyes and ears adjust to the cold, subterranean corridor, you notice that the tunnel isn't as silent as the staircase above. An eerie, low-pitched sound echoes through the space—and you soon recognize it as a deep, incessant chanting.
