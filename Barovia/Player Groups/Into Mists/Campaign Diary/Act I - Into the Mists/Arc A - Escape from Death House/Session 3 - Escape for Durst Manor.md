## Recap

Reaching the lower bowels of Durst Manor, the party found themselves plunged into the unfamiliar dirge of the Durst Cult's Dungeon. After exploring the larder and fighting the flayed innards of Gustave Durst fashioned into a Grick, the group continued around the cultists quarters, finding items and learning of the member's histories. After an encounter with previous Cult members turned ghouls, the party found Meowth, one of [[Sir Gus Gus|Sir Gus]]'s retainers, buried alive in the empty family crypt beginning to be rescued.
With Meowth recovered, but James still missing, the group descended into the deepest part of the house before discovering a Ritual Chamber guarded by the slumbering mound of flesh foretold in the house above. With only an hour until midnight, the group attacked, refusing the Alter's call for a blood sacrifice.

During the fight, [[Sir Gus Gus|Sir Gus]], [[Scarlet]], and [[Valeria]] were dealt heavy blows, with [[Stumpfoot]] attempting to command the mound into submission using Elisabeth's Amber Necklace. With Walter's name on his lips, and the sharpness of their blades, the party fought back on equal footing with the Flesh Mound. At long last it was [[Scarlet]] and her dragon who dealt the killing blow to Walter, the Graveborn, severing the child's corpse from the monster grown from it.

They had little time to breathe however, as the banshee form of Elizabeth Durst appeared to them, promising to bury them with the house for destroying her pet. The group fled, matching fast pace as they ran. The apparition of Gustav Durst appeared before them, begging them to give their lives up and die to satiate Elizabeth's spirit, he relented however when his children took the side of the players. "Don't fear them," he rasped. "Their only power is fear."

Moving through the room holding a statue of a mysterious figure, [[Valeria]] stole the Seer's Orb in its grasp as they passed, using the secret wall to ascend into the Hunter's Den. Once more in the main rooms of the manor, Elizabeth's shrilled ghostly hands attempted to grapple them through the chimneys and pull them down to die, but with their cunning the group made it out safely.

Taking stock, the group travel from the house a part way, with the two ghost children commenting on their new surroundings finding similarity with the Svalich Woods, where the children grew up although this would be a different part of it. Putting up in an old fort nearby, the party pass the rest of the night in an uneasy peace...
