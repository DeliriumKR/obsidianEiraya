_An adventure for five 4th-level characters._

In this arc, the players escort [[Ireena Kolyana]] to [[Arc D - St. Andral's Feast|St. Andral's Church]] in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], fulfilling their vow to her brother, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]. However, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]], the church's priest, informs them that the bones of [[Saint Andral]]—the source of the church's protective magic—have recently been stolen, placing its wards and parishioners at risk.

The players have until the night of their fifth day after arriving in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] to identify the thief (the church groundskeeper, [[Milivoj]]), track down the bones to their hiding place (the [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] coffin maker's shop), and return them to their rightful place in the church. Their mission will bring them into direct conflict with [[Volenta Popofsky]], [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s most sadistic vampiric bride, and her vampiric minions.

Can the players defeat [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]]'s plan and restore the church's protection? Or will the church be lost in darkness and blood, its flickering light snuffed out in the shadows?

> [!example]- An Early Start
> If the players bring [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to [[Arc D - St. Andral's Feast|St. Andral's Church]] on their first night in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] (i.e., "day zero" in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]), they arrive to find [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] finishing a service to his congregation. After giving reassurances to [[Willemina Rikalova]] (see [[Arc C - Into the Valley]] for more information about [[Willemina Rikalova|Willemina]]), [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] welcomes the players and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to the church and offers his assistance.
> 
> If told that [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] hopes to find sanctuary at the church, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] is glad to offer her a pallet to sleep on in the chapel. After [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] offers to compensate him for his kindness, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] considers her request, then invites her to assist with [[Yeska]]'s chores and education for the duration of her stay—a request which [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] graciously accepts.
> 
> The following morning, after [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s bones are stolen as described below, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] visits the players at [[Arc C - Into the Valley#C12b. The Blue Water Inn|the Blue Water Inn]] before their conversation with [[Urwin Martikov]] described in [[Arc C - Into the Valley]] and asks them to visit the church to speak with [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] about an "incident." ([[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] has asked her not to speak of the incident outside of the church, for fear of raising a panic.) The remainder of this arc then proceeds normally.
# D1. St. Andral's Church 

_This scene takes place in Chapter 5: Area N1._

> [!cutscene] When the players approach the church, read:
> This slouching, centuries-old stone church has a bulging steeple in the back and walls lined with cracked, stained glass windows depicting pious saints. A fence of wrought iron encloses a garden of gravestones next to the church. A thin mist creeps among the graves.

This church is dedicated to the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]] and named after [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]], whose bones once rested under the altar.

[[Father Lucian Petrovich]] (LG male human [priest](https://2014.5e.tools/bestiary.html#priest_mm)) oversees the church and does his best to raise spirits. Assisting him is an orphan and altar boy named [[Yeska]] (LG male human noncombatant). A brawny lad with a perpetually furrowed brow named [[Milivoj]] tends the grounds and digs graves.

At night, the church is packed with 2d6 + 6 [frightened](https://2014.5e.tools/conditionsdiseases.html#frightened_phb) [[Vallakians|Vallakian]] adults (male and female human commoners and 2d6 equally terrified [[Vallakians|Vallakian]] children (male and female human noncombatants). [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] offers his nightly congregation his prayers and the promise of [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s protection. Among [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]]'s nightly flock is a sad old woman named [[Willemina Rikalova]]. Her son, the shoemaker [[Udo Lukovich]], has been imprisoned for speaking out against the burgomaster. She prays that her son will be set free.

The church's occupants follow the following schedule unless interrupted:

- At dawn, [[Yeska]] joins [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] for prayers in the chapel and assists him in preparing breakfast.
- In the morning, [[Yeska]] runs errands around [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] while [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] sweeps the chapel, dusts the pews, polishes the altar, and tidies up the kitchen.
- In the afternoon, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] teaches [[Yeska]] how to read, and educates him in basic history and theology.
- In the evening, with [[Yeska]]'s assistance, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] leads the congregation in prayer and delivers a sermon promising sanctuary and comfort.

> [!tip]- The Stolen Bones
> Though he helped [[Strahd von Zarovich|House Von Zarovich]] ascend to power, [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]] ironically remained a fierce and powerful foe of the undead for all his life. As Most High Priest of the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]]'s church, [[Saint Andral|Andral]] directed fierce crusades against undead that lurked in the dark places of King Barov's kingdom, rooting them out wherever they could be found.
> 
> So great was his hatred of undeath that, in his final hours of life, [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]] vowed that his resting place would forever be a sanctuary from the forces of darkness. Since then, his bones have been interred in the crypt beneath [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]'s church, its priests performing an annual ritual at dawn each year on his holy day - the day of [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s Feast. So long as this rite is completed, the church remains hallowed ground for an additional year, as described in Bones of [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]] (p. 97).
> 
> When [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] awoke from his recent hibernation, his vampiric bride [[Volenta Popofsky]] decided to impress him the only way she knew how: with a wanton display of suffering, carnage, and terror. Where better, she thought, than a gruesome massacre at [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s Church on the night of its most holy feast?
> 
> It was a dark and windy night when [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] paid a visit to [[Henrik van der Voort]], [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]'s coffin-maker. Finding a macabre pleasure in the setting, and finding the lonely [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] a perfect target for her plots, [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] politely threatened to burn his shop to the ground unless he allowed her to use it as a base for her machinations.
> 
> A terrified [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] soon capitulated, and [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] established a link with the teleportation brazier in [[Castle Ravenloft]]'s dungeons. Using that link, she summoned two feral **vampire spawn**—former members of [[Doru]]'s rebellion driven mad with bloodlust—and a trio of crates filled with grave dirt to rest in.
> 
> A remnant of an older age, [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]] knew that [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s remains provided the church with its blessed protection. She commanded [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] to find and steal those bones before the night of [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s Feast - by any means necessary.
> 
> Given his profession, [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] had encountered [[Milivoj]]—the church's groundskeeper—on more than one occasion. He knew that [[Milivoj]] was familiar with the church's occupants and layout, that [[Milivoj]] thought little of the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]]'s faith, and—most importantly—that [[Milivoj]] had a host of younger siblings he was desperate to feed.
> 
> Digging into his own savings for funds, [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] approached [[Milivoj]] with a story and an offer. [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]], [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] claimed, was an ancestor of [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]]'s own family—and one whose remains [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] was anxious to claim. "In these darkened times," [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] said somberly, "we all want our families close at hand."
> 
> [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] told [[Milivoj]] his family had searched for [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s remains for centuries—but that only recently had he learned them to be located somewhere in the church. Doubtless, he claimed, the good [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] would be loathe to surrender such a relic, even though their only true value was sentimental.
> 
> That was where [[Milivoj]] came in. In exchange for a payment of fifteen electrum pieces, [[Milivoj]] would find and retrieve [[Saint Andral|Andral]]'s remains. Old legends, [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] noted, indicated that those remains carried [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s blessing, sanctifying the church from evil—though he personally doubted they were true. He suggested [[Milivoj]] use those legends, however, as an excuse to inquire about the remains' location, either from [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] or from [[Yeska]], the altar boy. ("Of course," [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] noted with a dry chuckle, "I'm fairly certain I've seen [[Izek Strazni]] entering the church, so perhaps those legends have lost their luster for good cause, eh?")
> 
> [[Milivoj]], eager to secure funds to care for his siblings, was easily convinced to steal those "moldy old relics" and soon agreed to [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]]'s offer. He knew [[Yeska]], a recent orphan, was a timid and fearful child who looked to [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] for safety and comfort. Though he couldn't escape the guilt he felt for leveraging the boy's fear, [[Milivoj]] decided that a few nights of [[Yeska]]'s nightmares were a worthy price to pay to ensure his own family had food to eat.
> 
> Six days later, shortly before [[Yeska]]'s lessons with [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]], [[Milivoj]] wondered aloud in front of the boy whether [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] might attack the church with an army of vampires and demons. "I heard vampires hate the sun," [[Milivoj]] said darkly as [[Yeska]]'s face paled. "And if the Devil came here, what could we possibly do to stop him?"
> 
> When [[Yeska]]'s lesson began shortly thereafter, [[Milivoj]] eavesdropped outside the door—and silently cheered when [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] revealed the bones' location beneath the altar. That same night, a cloaked and hooded [[Milivoj]] returned to the church with his shovel in hand, creeping through the darkened chapel and forcing open the crypt that lurked below.
> 
> But a splintering floorboard betrayed him—and when [[Milivoj]] emerged from the crypt, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] emerged to block the exit. Without recognizing him, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] demanded the intruder reveal his face and relinquish what he had stolen. [[Milivoj]] panicked and fled through one of the church's glass windows, shattering it. [[Milivoj]] then delivered the bones to [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]], who paid him.
> 
> [[Yeska]] doesn't yet know that the bones were stolen. Instead, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] told him only that a broken tree branch had crashed through the window, breaking the glass and damaging the floor. The following dawn, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] sent [[Yeska]] to [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]]'s shop to obtain planks and nails for the repair, which [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] delivered personally to scope out whether [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Lucian]] suspected his involvement.
> 
> [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] doesn't know who stole the bones or why. Though he gently interrogated [[Yeska]] as to whether he told anyone about the bones, [[Yeska]] truthfully told him that he hadn't. [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] has been unable to discern more from his own brief inspection of the crime scene. With the date of reconsecration fast approaching, however, he fears the worst.
## D1a. Entering the Church 
---
When the players first move to enter the church after the bones have been stolen, [[Henrik van der Voort]] emerges at the same time, forcing one of the players to make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or crash into him.

Whether the player succeeds or fails, the near-impact makes [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] trip, sending him tumbling to the ground. As he does, he loses his hold on a bundle of nails and planks held in his arms, which scatter across the stairs and earth below. The farsighted [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] also loses his pair of half-cracked spectacles in the fall, which land across the steps a short ways beneath him.

The players can help [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] collect his glasses, nails, and planks as he scrambles helplessly to find them. If they do, he thanks them profusely, dabbing at his face and hands with a slightly soiled handkerchief. He is willing to share the following information if directly asked:

- His name is [[Henrik van der Voort]], and he is [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]'s resident coffin-maker and occasional carpenter.
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] asked him to visit to deliver some tools and supplies to repair some damage to the floor caused by a falling tree branch the previous night.
- His shop can be found at the south end of Arasek Stockyard. "Although," [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] jokes awkwardly, "I do hope you won't need my services too soon."

[[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]] then excuses himself and departs to return to his shop.
## D1b. The Chapel 
---
> [!cutscene] When the players first enter this area, read:
> 
> A dozen ornate candelabras bathe rows of well-kept pews in candlelight, casting a soft luminescence that touches every corner of this chapel. At the far end of the room, a wooden altar stands proudly, carved with a proud sunburst with rays thrusting forth in cheery defiance. Six tall windows flank the altar, though one appears to have been broken, with glass shards lining its dark iron pane like jagged teeth.
> 
> A broad-shouldered, black-haired young man stands atop a small stepladder before the broken window, nailing a tarp into place to cover it as a young boy sweeps the chapel floor not far away. A middle-aged priest, with graying hair and crisp, clean vestments watches them work from the pews, holding a broom of his own and looking lost in thought.

The young man is [[Milivoj]], who is as described in N1. [[Arc D - St. Andral's Feast|St. Andral's Church]] (p. 97). The priest is [[Father Lucian Petrovich]]. The boy is [[Yeska]].

> [!handout]- "Father Lucian Petrovich" by Caleb Cleveland
> ![[Father Lucian Petrovich by Caleb Cleveland.png]]

When the players first meet [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]], he greets them warmly, recognizing them as newcomers to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], welcoming them to [[Arc D - St. Andral's Feast|St. Andral's Church]], and asking if they have come seeking fellowship or to pray to the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]].

After the players have exchanged pleasantries, [[Milivoj]] dismounts his stepladder and returns it to [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]]. The following exchange then takes place, giving the players generous time and opportunity to interrupt and respond:

- Upon noticing the players, [[Milivoj]] immediately scowls, and asks, "Father, are these outsiders bothering you? I can ask them to leave."
- If the players say nothing, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] chides [[Milivoj]], noting that, "In these dark times, it's never been more important to be hospitable to others."
- If rebuffed, [[Milivoj]] retorts: "You can't be too sure about strangers. I thought the town gates were supposed to be closed. They could be vampires, or worse." He then glowers at the players, and asks, "Unless you have some way of proving that you're not?"

[[Milivoj]] is eager to prevent further investigation of the church, and hopes to persuade [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] to drive the players away. However, he's not willing to look suspicious, and drops the issue if the players or [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] push back. "You can't be too careful," he mumbles. "Be safe, Father." He then departs.

Once [[Milivoj]] leaves, if [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] is informed that [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is seeking sanctuary in the church from [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] or other monsters, he first ensures that no other congregants are present—shooing away [[Yeska]] if present—and swears the players to secrecy.

If the players agree not to spread his words beyond the church, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] sorrowfully informs them that, while he would love nothing more than to extend [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] an offer of permanent shelter, recent events have left the church's wards in a precarious state. He can also share the following additional information at the players' prompting:

- The church is ordinarily hallowed ground, as though the building was protected by a _hallow_ spell. This magical ward prevents fiends and undead from entering the church, and keeps them from magically charming, frightening, or possessing those within it.
- The source of this protection is the crypt of [[Saint Andral]], which has historically held the blessed bones of [[Saint Andral|Andral]] himself, the founder of [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]'s church and a great cleric of the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]].
- Originally, only [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] knew of the bones' existence. However, after news the siege of [[The Village of Barovia|Barovia]] reached [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] a few days ago, he shared the knowledge of the bones with [[Yeska]] to put the fearful boy at ease, as described in Bones of St. Andral (p. 97).
- To retain the church's protection, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] must invoke a particular rite of protection over [[Saint Andral]]'s bones once every year, at dawn on the morning of [[Saint Andral]]'s Feast—a holy day that memorializes [[Saint Andral|Andral]]'s life.
- If the rite cannot be carried out at that time, the wards will fall until the rite is completed on a subsequent dawn.
- Last night, someone broke into the church's crypt and stole [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s bones, damaging the floorboards behind the altar and escaping through a window. Without the bones, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] can't complete the protective rite, and the wards will fall at dawn on the day of St. [[Saint Andral|Andral]]'s Feast.
- [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] is fearful that some fell creature or wicked soul has manufactured this crisis as an opportunity to cause his congregation harm; though the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Baron]] is confident that no monsters could breach [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]'s walls, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] fears that the town is not as safe as it appears.

[[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] can also share the date of [[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s Feast, which will take place on the fifth day after the players arrived in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]. He has not reported the theft of the bones for fear of the distress that the news might cause, and he doesn't want to ruin the burgomaster's festival. He does not suspect [[Milivoj]] of stealing the bones either, having no reason to do so.

If the players express an interest in doing so, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] is glad to allow them to inspect the crime scene—having made neither heads nor tails of it himself—and to interview [[Yeska]], so long as they promise to be patient and gentle with the boy.

If the players ask for the identities of other possible witnesses, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] notes that the only other employee of the church is the groundskeeper, [[Milivoj]]. [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] can give the players directions to [[Milivoj]]’s house, which is located in the northwestern quarter of [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]].

[[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] accompanies the players as they complete their investigation, answering additional questions when asked. If the players' investigation takes them beyond the church, he insists on joining them and asks [[Yeska]] to attend the chapel in his absence. (He takes personal responsibility for the bones' disappearance, and—given his connections across the town and his service to the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]]—wishes to assist the players in recovering them.)

While accompanying the party, [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] fights alongside them, but allows the players to take the lead in social encounters and exploration.

> [!warning]- Father Lucian's Aid
> Without [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]]'s assistance—and, specifically, the damage output and radiant damage provided by his _spirit guardians_ spell and **_divine eminence_** feature—the battle at the coffin-maker's shop in [[D4c. Volenta's Trap]] is nearly impossible. To avoid a TPK, ensure he accompanies the players upon their departure from the church.
## D1c. The Scene of the Crime 
---
[[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] is glad to lead the players to the location of the crypt if prompted.

> [!cutscene] Read:
> A small pile of fresh wooden boards rests against the altar, a small pouch of nails sitting atop their surface. Not far away, the old wooden floorboards behind the crypt have been pried up and broken, with splintered edges jutting out at odd angles. Between them, a small, dark opening descends into a dark, dusty space.

The fresh boards and nails were delivered by [[Henrik van der Voort|Henrik]]. The opening is barely wide enough to allow one person to enter, and descends into the crypt.

[[Saint Andral|St. Andral]]'s crypt is a 10-foot-square, 5-foot high chamber beneath the chapel, lying largely beneath the chapel's altar.

> [!cutscene] If a player enters the crypt, read:
> You descend into a small, dark, damp chamber, the walls made of rough-hewn stone blocks stained with age and moisture. At the center stands a lonely stone slab, an empty, circular depression carved neatly into its surface.

The slab held the bones until [[Milivoj]] stole them.

The players can find the following information by investigating the area around the crypt:

- While investigating the floorboards, the players can find a torn piece of gray wool fabric snagged on a nail with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, and a line of rust-stained dirt smeared across a floorboard with a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check.

- While investigating the interior of the crypt, the players can find several clumps of earth with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check. Each clump is in the shape of a large bootprint, and contains several blades of pale green grass and white flower petals.

- While investigating the altar or the stone slab in the crypt, the players can find a few strands of dark black hair with a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

The fabric was torn from [[Milivoj]]'s shirt as he lowered himself down, and the rust was left when he used his shovel to pry up the floorboards.

The clumps of earth were left when [[Milivoj]]'s boots hit the floor of the crypt. [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] can inform the players that the petals are from the ramson plant, which grow in several patches in the church graveyard.

The hair is [[Milivoj]]'s.
## D1d. Interviewing Yeska 
---
If the players choose to interview [[Yeska]], [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] asks them not to press him too hard for information. The boy is still emotionally fragile from the death of his parents three months ago, and [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] doesn't wish to harm his mental well-being over a mere suspicion of danger. ([[Yeska]] doesn't know that the bones have been stolen; [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] has been careful to keep him away from the hole behind the altar.)

If one of the players asks [[Yeska]] whether he has told anyone else about the bones, he truthfully denies doing so. However, if the players ask whether anyone might have overheard his conversation with [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]], [[Yeska]] shares that [[Milivoj]] was also in the church at that time. ([[Yeska]], though alarmed by the direction of the conversation, can also be persuaded to share that [[Milivoj]]'s tales of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] potentially attacking the church encouraged him to ask [[Father Lucian Petrovich|Father Lucian]] about the church's protection in the first place.)

# D2. Milivoj's House

[[Milivoj]]’s house is located in the impoverished northwest quarter of Vallaki, a short walk from St. Andral’s Church.

> [!cutscene] When the players head there, read:
> The muddy road that leads into the town’s northwest quarter is rough and uneven, chilled by a persistent fog that seems to cling to the soaked earth beneath your feet. As you move further from the town’s center, the streets narrow and the houses grow grimier and more dilapidated, the smell of damp wood and mildew filling your nostrils.
> 
> Your path leads you to a leaning, decrepit structure that seems to sag beneath its own weight. Its timbers are rotting, the windows cracked and filthy. At its front, a ramshackle wooden door stands slightly askew in its frame atop a small, mud-spattered porch.

If the players knock on the door, it’s answered a few moments thereafter by Jarzinka, [[Milivoj]]’s mother. 

> [!cutscene] Read:
> 
> The door groans open, revealing a gaunt, glassy-eyed woman standing on the other side. Her hair is matted with grease and hangs in knots across her shoulders, and a painted beaded necklace hangs around her neck, its colors faded and chipped with age.
> 
> Behind her, a trio of young children wrestle and shout as they roll across a cramped living space stuffed with old, threadbare furniture and an old, stained rug. Two other children—a near-adolescent boy with long, shaggy hair, and a freckled girl of similar age wearing cracked, oversized glasses—peer curiously around a pair of overstuffed, patchwork armchairs at the sight of you.
> 
> The woman at the door grunts, her hollow gaze scanning you expectantly.

The children in the armchairs are a twelve-year-old boy named Bogan and a ten-year-old girl named Zondra. The three children wrestling on the ground are named Lazlo (eight years old), Grilsha (seven years old), and Dargos (five years old).

Jarzinka is a woman of few words, and is annoyed because she has just finished the last of her dream pastries. If the players ask to speak with [[Milivoj]], she turns to Bogan and Zondra, then grunts at them. The conversation then proceeds as follows:

- Bogan cheerfully informs the players that [[Milivoj]] is sick and doesn’t want to talk to anyone today.
- If the players succeed on a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check or insist that the matter is urgent, Zondra turns and hollers, “Milo! Someone wants to speak to you.”
  
A few moments later, the nineteen-year-old [[Milivoj]] exits a swollen wooden door at the back of the room, with his three-year-old brother Jirko giggling delightedly from atop [[Milivoj]]’s shoulders and his four-year-old twin sisters, Victoria and Vasha, hanging from his biceps.
## D2a. Confronting Milivoj
---
Upon spotting the players, Milivoj’s face visibly falls, and he gently shakes Victoria and Vasha from his arms and sets Jirko down in Bogan’s lap. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals his body language has grown tense, and that he is shifting uncomfortably. 

As Milivoj reaches the door, he tersely addresses Jarzinka as “Mother” and gives her a grudging nod. Jarzinka grunts and shuffles away from the door, disappearing into the room from which Milivoj came.

If the players inform Milivoj that they want to speak with him about St. Andral’s bones, he scowls, insists that he knows nothing about the matter, and attempts to close the door. A player can prevent him from doing so with a successful DC 10 Strength or Dexterity check. (If Milivoj successfully closes the door, the players can make him open it again by making a sufficient nuisance of themselves, by succeeding on a DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation or Persuasion) check, or by forcing the door down with a successful DC 10 Strength check.)

Milivoj denies any knowledge of the bones or their theft if asked about them outright. However, he claims to have seen a cloaked figure watching the church two days ago from an alleyway. (The description of the cloaked figure coincidentally matches the appearance of Ernst Larnak, Fiona's spy, though Milivoj doesn't know Ernst or the nature of his employment.) A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that he is speaking slightly too quickly.

If the players accuse Milivoj of stealing the bones and succeed on a DC 15 Charisma (Intimidation) check, Milivoj admits to stealing them, as described in <span class="citation">Bones of St. Andral (p. 97)</span>. Players who confront Milivoj with evidence from the crypt automatically succeed. Milivoj can't take the players to the coffin maker's shop himself, but notes that Father Lucian can lead them there.

If asked his motive for stealing the bones, Milivoj shares the reasons described in <span class="citation">Bones of St. Andral (p. 97)</span>. He can also share that, after his father—a former Vallakian guard—was  wounded in a recent wolf attack, both of his parents began regularly purchasing dream pastries from the peddler Morgantha outside of the gates. With both parents addicted to Morgantha's wares, Milivoj sees himself as his siblings' sole means of avoiding total poverty. (If asked, Milivoj can provide a basic description of the effects of dream pastries, as described in <span class="citation">Dream Pastries (p. 125)</span>.)

If informed that the bones may have been stolen to allow an attack upon the church, Milivoj dismisses the idea, insisting that the bones are just a "moldy old relic" and that "he doesn't have time to believe in fairy tales." He can also share that Henrik told him the bones were a powerless family heirloom, and that Henrik sought to recover them to honor his ancestor.

> [!example]- Milivoj’s Revelation
> If he is later informed that Henrik's actions were directed by one of Strahd's vampire spawn, and that the theft of the bones could have allowed a slaughter at the church, [[Milivoj]] is overcome with anxiety, horror, and guilt. He prostrates himself before Father Lucian and begs for his forgiveness, offering to exile himself to the Svalich Woods if doing so will make up for the harm he has caused. (Father Lucian, of course, declines, tearfully embracing and forgiving Milivoj instead.)

## D2b. Departing the House
---
Once Milivoj has admitted to the bones' theft, [Father Lucian](app://obsidian.md/Non-Player%20Characters#Father%20Lucian%20Petrovich) can lead the players to the coffin maker's shop. (He knows the owner, Henrik, well, and hopes that he can reason with the man.) If the players appear skeptical, Father Lucian—who has the statistics of a **priest**—reveals that he bears the holy symbol of Tasha Petrovna—his ancestor and a mighty follower of Saint Markovia—and promises them that he is more than capable of defending himself.

If the players suggest reporting the theft of the bones to the burgomaster, Father Lucian is reluctant to do so, fearing the possibility of raising a panic. With a successful DC 15 Charisma (Persuasion) check, however, the players can convince Father Lucian to join them in reporting the theft to Baron Vallakovich, who responds as described in **N6. Coffin Maker's Shop.** (If the players don't have Father Lucian with them, the burgomaster refuses to believe that the bones are responsible for the church's divine protection or to assist the players in recovering them.)

> [!example]- Reporting the Theft 
> If the players report the theft to Baron Vallakovich and do not accompany his guards, the four guards gain access to the coffin maker's shop as described in N6. Coffin Maker's Shop, but are slaughtered when they accidentally trigger Volenta's trap and alert the vampires to their presence.
> 
> One day later, Baron Vallakovich responds by sending Izek to summon the players to N3. Burgomaster's Mansion, where he accuses them of causing his faithful guards to disappear and threatens to exile them from Vallaki. (The players can win back his good graces by promising to recover the bones themselves.)

# D3. Arasek Stockyard

Arasek Stockyard is largely as described in N5. Arasek Stockyard (p. 115). However, while Rictavio's wagon is mostly covered by old and faded paint, the Carnival of Wonders sign on its side is brand new and fresh-painted.

If one of the players expresses an interest in breaking into the wagon, [Father Lucian](app://obsidian.md/Non-Player%20Characters#Father%20Lucian%20Petrovich) discourages them from doing so if he is present.

If a player nonetheless attempts to unlock or force open the door to the wagon, the entire wagon suddenly rocks violently from side to side. The players can also hear the sound of something with large, heavy claws scratching against the interior of the wagon. (The rocking and scratches are made by the ghost of Erasmus van Richten, a **poltergeist** seeking to protect Arabelle by scaring visitors away.)

If the players successfully break the door to the wagon or pick its padlock, they find that the wagon’s interior contains a soft bed of straw, a comfortable woolen blanket, a few books, and a young Vistana girl—Arabelle—who is clutching a plush saber-toothed tiger to her chest and wearing a beaded necklace with a carved copper amulet. (For more information about Arabelle, see [Arc E - The Missing Vistana](app://obsidian.md/Arc%20E%20-%20The%20Missing%20Vistana).)

# D4. Coffin Maker's Shop

The coffin maker's shop is largely as described in N6. Coffin Maker's Shop (p. 116). However, the crates in N6f. Vampire Nest (p. 118) have been replaced by three coffins packed with grave dirt from Castle Ravenloft, which contain two **vampire spawn** and **[[Volenta Popofsky]]**, one of Strahd's vampiric brides. In addition, players who explore N6f. Vampire Nest (p. 118) find a faded green-tinged pentagram 5 feet in diameter burned onto the floor at the edge of the room, just beyond the vampires' coffins.

> [!tip]- The Burned Pentagram 
> The green pentagram is a remnant of Volenta's use of the teleportation brazier in K78. Brazier Room (p. 82). If asked, Henrik doesn't know what it signifies. However, he can share with the players that, one night shortly after he first met Volenta, a sickly green light flashed through the shop, with her two vampire spawn companions exiting from N6f. Vampire Nest (p. 118) shortly thereafter.

Henrik van der Voort, the coffin maker, follows the following schedule:

- In the morning, he sleeps in, remaining in bed in **N6e. Henrik's Bedroom**.
- In the late morning, he anxiously checks that the wardrobe containing St. Andral's bones hasn't been disturbed, and then prepares breakfast in **N6d. Kitchen**.
- In the afternoon, he builds coffins in **N6c. Workshop**.
- In the evening, he prepares an evening meal in **N6d. Kitchen**.
- At night, he sleeps in **N6e. Henrik's Bedroom.**
## D4a. Entering the Shop
---
The players cannot access the shop through persuasion, deception, or intimidation; in each case, Henrik will respond as described in **N6. Coffin Maker's Shop**.

Additionally, note that the windows are locked from the inside and the doors are barred. As such, the players cannot open a window or door by use of _thieves tools_. Instead, the players can enter the shop by either of the following means:

- They can break down one or both of the barred doors with a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check. Doing so alerts Henrik, who comes to confront them. (Doing so doesn't alert Volenta or the **vampire spawn**, who merely assume Henrik has dropped a coffin or other wooden object.)
- They can use magic (e.g., _mage hand_ or _misty step_) to open the windows or doors from the inside. Doing so avoids alerting Henrik, who remains in his current location.

In either case, Henrik offers no resistance as soon as he sees that the players have entered the shop. Instead, he rightfully guesses that they have come to recover the bones and informs them of the bones' location and the danger of the vampire nest, as described in **N6. Coffin Maker's Shop**. In exchange, he pleads with them to protect him from the vampires, who he rightfully fears will butcher him for his betrayal. He won't retrieve the bones alone, but will accompany the players upstairs if demanded.

Henrik does not know that Volenta has secretly installed a poison needle trap and tripwire bell in the wardrobe secret compartment where the bones are kept. He assumes that the players will be able to quietly recover the bones, depart the shop, and escort him elsewhere to safety.

> [!example]- Ambushing the Vampires
> 
> Players who attempt to ambush the vampires in N6f. Vampire Nest (p. 118) before recovering the bones must succeed on a DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) check to approach a crate without awakening the nearby vampires, and a DC 14 Dexterity (Stealth) check with disadvantage to open it. A woken vampire attacks intruders on sight.

## D4b. Recovering the Bones
---
The bones have been concealed as described in N6e. Henrik's Bedroom (p. 117). However, Volenta Popofsky has added two additional safeguards to the secret compartment:

- a **poison needle** trap (Dungeon Master's Guide, p. 123), which triggers unless a particular wooden panel is pushed before the compartment is opened, and
- a hidden wire attached to the compartment's opening, which connects to a noisemaker at the base of the compartment shaped vaguely like the head of the toymaker Gadof Blinsky, including his jester’s cap and bells.

The poison needle trap can be identified and disarmed as described in the Dungeon Master's Guide (p. 123).

> [!warning]- Which Needle? 
> There are two official poison needle traps in _Dungeons & Dragons_ 5th Edition: the **_poison needle_** provided on page 123 of the _Dungeon Master's Guide_, and the **_poison needle trap_** provided on page 114 of _Xanathar's Guide to Everything_. This guide refers to the former, which merely poisons its victim instead of paralyzing them.

The hidden wire can be identified before the compartment is fully opened with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check, and disarmed with a successful DC 20 Dexterity (Thieves' Tools) check.

Opening the compartment without disabling the wire or unsuccessfully attempting to disarm the wire causes the noisemaker to loudly screech, “Is no fun, is no Blinsky!” repeatedly for 1 minute, alerting the vampires in **N6f. Vampire Nest**.

> [!tip]- The Noisemaker
> Volenta purchased the noisemaker from Gadof Blinsky of Blinsky Toys, described further in N7. Blinsky Toys (p. 118), several nights ago. Though tempted to kill him or take the toy by force, Blinsky's affinity for the macabre led Volenta to regard him as a kindred spirit, and she elected to spare his life on a whim.

> [!example]- Disabling the Noisemaker 
> If the players successfully retrieve the bones without alerting the vampires, Volenta discovers the bones to be missing shortly after she awakens at dusk that night. If Henrik is still within the shop, she disembowels and beheads him, then leaves his head staked on a spear leaning against the statue at the center of N8. Town Square (p. 119). In either case, Volenta then departs Vallaki for Castle Ravenloft, slinking back to the keep in shame.

## D4c. Volenta's Trap
---
If the players allow the noisemaker to activate, Volenta and her two loyal **vampire spawn** arise to confront them one round later, either by forcing their way into **N6d. Kitchen** or (if the players have already exited **N6e. Henrik's Bedroom**) by obstructing the players' path down the stairs. When the vampires appear, they use their **_spider climb_** to clamber across the walls before dropping down to the players’ level, with Volenta crouching upside-down on the ceiling behind them.

> [!handout]- "Volenta Popofsky" by Caleb Cleveland
> ![[Volenta Popofsky by Caleb Cleveland.png]]

Volenta uses the two vampire spawn with her as cover, placing them between her and the players. She then greets them as follows, providing them with an opportunity to respond each time:

- Volenta addresses the players as "her Lord's new toys" with amusement and disbelief.
- She claims that they're "less impressive" than she'd expected, and boasts that neither they nor "Ludmilla, Anastrasya, or her Lord's skinny new plaything could hold a candle to her vision." (The "skinny new plaything" is referring to Escher.)
- She insists that the players couldn't stop her scheme if they tried. "Once I make the pews of your little church run red with blood," she raves, "my beloved will recognize the real gem of his realm—_me!_"
- She observes that it's lucky that they're in a coffin shop, adding, "After all, they'll need _somewhere_ to put your parts when I'm through with you." She then directs the other vampires to attack.

> [!combat]- Fight against the First Bride
> Due to the phase mechanic and chokepoint, this is a series of two consecutive **bruising** combat encounters against a party of five 4th-level players and a CR 3 ally (Father Lucien), with each consuming approximately 24% of the players' total maximum hit points (for a total of 48% of their maximum hit points). Adjust the Encounter using the following, depending on group size:
> 
>> [!combat]- Three Players
>> Remove the **vampire spawn**.
>> ```encounter
>> name: The First Bride (3)
>> creatures:
>>   - 1: [["Volenta, First Form"]]
>> ```
> 
>> [!combat]- Four Players
>> Decrease the number of **vampire spawn** to one.
>> ```encounter
>> name: The First Bride (4)
>> creatures:
>>   - 1: [["Volenta, First Form"]]
>>   - 1: Vampire Spawn
>> ```
>
>> [!combat]- Five Players
>> As Standard
>> ```encounter
>> name: The First Bride (5)
>> creatures:
>>   - 1: [["Volenta, First Form"]]
>>   - 2: Vampire Spawn
>> ```
>
>> [!combat]- Six Players
>> Increase the number of **vampire spawn** to three.
>> ```encounter
>> name: The First Bride (6)
>> creatures:
>>   - 1: [["Volenta, First Form"]]
>>   - 3: Vampire Spawn
>> ``` 
> 

> [!warning]- Sunlight in Barovia 
> Remember that vampires and other creatures in Barovia are unaffected by Barovian daylight, as described in Sunlight in Barovia (p. 24).

> [!warning]- Vampires Aren't Humanoid 
> Remember that vampire spawn, including Volenta, have the undead type, rather than the humanoid type. As such, spells and effects that target only humanoids, such as _hold person_, or which can't affect undead, such as _command_, have no effect on Volenta and the vampires accompanying her.
