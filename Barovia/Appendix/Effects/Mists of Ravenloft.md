A deadly fog surrounds the land of Barovia and engulfs any creature that tries to leave. Even flying creatures are subject to the fog's effects, which are as follows:

- No matter how far a creature travels in the fog, or in which direction it goes, it gets turned around so that it eventually finds itself back in Barovia.
- The area within the fog is heavily obscured (see "[Vision and Light](https://2014.5e.tools/quickreference.html#bookref-quick,2,vision%20and%20light)" in chapter 8 of theÂ [Player's Handbook](https://2014.5e.tools/book.html#PHB)).
- Each time the players emerge from the wall of fog around Barovia, they must make a DC 5 Constitution saving throw or take 1 level of exhaustion, as the fog saps their energy and drains their life force. (The DC increases by 5 each time that the players pass through the fog again, and resets on a long rest.)
