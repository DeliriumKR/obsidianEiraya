After his armies occupied the valley and slew its inhabitants, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] repopulated the area with human subjects drawn from his other conquered lands. As a result, Barovians have a wide variety of ethnic backgrounds.

Barovians are deeply invested in their homes and their traditions. They are wary of strange peoples and customs. The way Barovians deal with strangers can be unsettling to those newcomers. Barovians have a tendency to stare openly, in silence, thereby expressing their disapproval of anything that isn't familiar to them. Barovians aren't talkative with strangers, to the extent of being pointedly rude. Most Barovians have violent tempers that boil up through their customary silence when they are provoked. They also have a social cohesiveness (thrust upon them by their weird circumstances) that can make them act together against outsiders if a Barovian is mistreated.

Barovians were a happy people once, but their history and current conditions aren't pleasant. If one manages to win the trust of a Barovian, one has a friend for life and a stalwart ally.

Barovian children aren't happy children. They are raised in a culture of fear and told time and again not to wander too far from their homes or enter the woods. They experience little hope or joy, and they are taught to fear the [[Strahd von Zarovich|devil Strahd]] above all.

Barovian adults eke out modest livings. With no new wealth pouring into the valley, they trade in old coins that bear the profile of their dark lord, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], as he looked when he was alive. They hide their precious baubles in their houses and dress plainly outdoors, so as not to attract the attention of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] or his spies.

Barovians live within a closed ecosystem. Every Barovian adult is expected to learn a trade or serve a function. Barovians stitch their own clothing, craft their own furniture, grow their own food, and make their own wine. With fewer than three thousand people living in the entire valley, finding the perfect mate isn't easy, so Barovians have learned to settle for what they can get.

## Barovians and Non-humans
---
Barovians are human. Although they know that dwarves, elves, halflings and other civilized races exist, few living Barovians have seen such "creatures," let alone interacted with them.

Aside from the secretive dusk elves of Vallaki (see [[Arc E - The Missing Vistana]]), the only nonhumans most Barovians are familiar with are the adventurers that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] has lured to his dark realm. Barovians thus react to nonhuman characters the same way most humans in the real world would react to elf, dwarf, or half-orc adventurers suddenly walking the streets. Most such outsiders are scorned, feared, or shunned.
## Barovian Lore
---
Typical Barovians know certain facts, or have certain beliefs, about their existence and their surroundings. This common lore is summarized here. Characters can learn this information after earning a Barovian's trust.

### The Devil Strahd

About [[Strahd von Zarovich]] and vampires, the Barovians believe the following:

- [[Strahd von Zarovich]] is a vampire, and he dwells in [[Arc O - Dinner with the Devil|Castle Ravenloft]]. No one is welcome at the castle.
- The [[Strahd von Zarovich|Devil Strahd]] is a curse placed on the land because of a forgotten sin of the Barovians' ancestors. (This is untrue, but Barovians believe it nonetheless.)
- A vampire must rest in its coffin during the day. At night, it can summon wolves and vermin to do its bidding. A vampire can transform into a bat, a wolf, or a cloud of mist. In its humanoid form, it can dominate you with its powerful gaze.
- A vampire can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.
- Running water burns a vampire like acid, and sunlight causes a vampire to burst into flame.
### The Land of Barovia

Barovians know the following facts about their homeland:

- Anyone who attempts to leave the land of Barovia begins to choke on the fog. Those who don't turn back perish.
- Many strangers have been drawn to Barovia over the years, but they all die or disappear before long.
- Wolves, dire wolves, and werewolves prowl the [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia#B3. Svalich Woods (C)|Svalich Woods]], and hungry bats fill the skies at night.
- [[The Village of Barovia]] sits at the east end of the valley. Its burgomaster is named [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich]].
- [[The Town of Vallaki]] lies in the heart of the valley. Its burgomaster is named [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich]].
- The fortified [[The Village of Krezk|village of Krezk]] lies at the west end of the valley and is built around an old abbey. The village burgomaster is named [[Burgomaster Dmitri Krezkov]].
- The Abbey of St Markova lies in the village of Krezk. Most outside of Krezk are unsure as to whether it still operates, though rumours abound that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] destroyed it long ago, leaving nothing more than ghosts to haunt its halls.
- Wine is the lifeblood of Barovia—for some, it is the only reason to keep living. Barovian taverns get their wine from the [[The Wizard of Wines Winery]] winery near [[The Village of Krezk|Krezk]].
#### Barovian Calendar

Barovia has its own calendar, and Barovians are accustomed to measuring the passage of time using it. The current Barovian year is 735 B.C. (Barovian Calendar). The Barovian calendar has twelve 28-day months, each with names listed in the Barovian calender.

[[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] was born in 306. In 346, he inherited his father's crown, lands, and army. [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] conquered the valley in 347, finished construction of Castle Ravenloft in 350, and died and became a vampire in 351. The current year is 735.

### Beliefs and Superstitions

Barovians have deep-rooted religious beliefs and superstitions that they pass down from one generation to the next:

- Two divine forces watch over the Barovian people: the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]] and Mother Night.
- Before the curse of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] befell the land, the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]] watched over the Barovian people from sunrise until sundown. Now, the sun has not shone unobscured for centuries, and the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]] no longer answers their prayers.
- The presence of Mother Night is felt most strongly between dusk and dawn, although nighttime prayers to her go unanswered. It is widely believed that she has forsaken the Barovian people and sent the [[Strahd von Zarovich|devil Strahd]] to punish them for their ancestors' offenses.
- Spirits drift along the Old Svalich Road toward Castle Ravenloft in the dead of night. These phantoms are all that remain of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s enemies, and this damnable fate awaits anyone who opposes him.
- The Vistani alone are allowed to leave Barovia.
- Never harm a raven, lest ill fortune befall you. Ravens carry lost souls within them, so killing one is bad luck. (The ravens don't carry souls within.)
- Women with Red Hair bring bad luck, and the ire of the [[Strahd von Zarovich|devil]].
## Barovian Culture
---
The denizens of the Village of Barovia are a broken, haunted people.

Until recently, however, the village of Barovia faced few overt troubles. While not thriving, its residents eked out a meagre existence and lived as well as they could.

That changed when the priest’s son, [[Doru]]—emboldened by the arrival of the vampire hunter [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten]]—incited a Barovian mob to march against [[Castle Ravenloft]]. Awoken from his long slumber, [[Strahd von Zarovich]] laid waste to the members of the mob, killing many of the village’s beloved sons and daughters.

[[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] then roused an undead army and sent it against [[The Village of Barovia|the village]] as punishment for their insolence. The siege of [[The Village of Barovia|Barovia]] decimated the village, killing dozens and wounding many more.

The burgomaster, [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich]], and his children, [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] and [[Ireena Kolyana]], took charge of the defence effort. Even so, many Barovians, fearful of [[Strahd von Zarovich]]’s emergence and the shadow of [[Castle Ravenloft]], left their ruined homes and broken families and fled for [[The Town of Vallaki]] to the west, hoping that its high walls could bring security. Many of those who remained in the village turned on [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], blaming him and [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|his father]] for allowing [[Strahd von Zarovich|Stahd]] to awaken, and for failing to do more to prevent [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s counter strike. [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]—named for “[[Ismark, the Great]],” an ancestral hero who rooted out nests of vampires across the valley—is now scorned as “[[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark, the Lesser]].”

The village has fallen into a state of paranoia, hopelessness, and despair. Neighbours mistrust neighbours, fearful that any person could be a threat, charmed by a vampire—or, worse, a vampire in disguise. Few go out of doors, whether day or night. All avoid the church, a scarred and haunted building rumoured to be cursed by the Devil [[Strahd von Zarovich]] himself.
