Found in [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia]].

**Roleplaying Information**  
**_Resonance._** Ireena should inspire flattery with her genuine interest in the players' goals and interests, sympathy for her sense of guilt and fear of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], endearment for her determination to continue moving forward, and gratitude for her efforts to help the players succeed.

**_Emotions._** Ireena most often feels curious, thoughtful, melancholy, guilty, stubborn, joyful, determined, defiant, and anxious.

**_Motivations._** Ireena wants to keep her fellow [[Barovians]] and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] safe, honour her parents' memory, learn new stories, and one day explore distant lands.

**_Inspirations._** When playing Ireena, channel Belle (_Beauty and the Beast_), Elizabeth Swann (_Pirates of the Caribbean_), Eowyn (_Lord of the Rings_), Hermione Granger (_Harry Potter_), and Katniss Everdeen (_The Hunger Games_).

**Character Information**  
**_Persona._** To the world, Ireena is a compassionate, curious, yet stubborn young noblewoman. To those she trusts, Ireena is an anxious, yet determined young woman who dreams of freedom and adventure. Deep down, Ireena wonders whether giving herself up to [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] would be the best way to protect those she loves.

**_Morale._** In a fight, Ireena will always turn to words before a sword. If necessary to defend herself, though, she'll draw her rapier—reluctantly, if protecting herself, and proudly, if protecting another.

**_Relationships._** Ireena is the (knowing) adopted sister of [[Ismark Kolyanovich]], the (unknowing) sister of [[Izek Strazni]], and the second (unknowing) reincarnation of [[Tatyana Federovna]].
