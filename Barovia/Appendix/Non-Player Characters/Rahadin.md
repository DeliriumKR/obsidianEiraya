**Roleplaying Information**  
**_Resonance._** Rahadin should inspire anger for his condescension and unease for his deadly calm and undying devotion to carrying out [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s will.

**_Emotions._** Rahadin most often feels calm, disdainful, satisfied, bored, or irritated.

**_Motivations._** Rahadin wants to serve [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s will as his faithful, ever-loyal servant—no matter the cost to himself or others.

**_Inspirations._** When playing Rahadin, channel Tywin Lannister (_Game of Thrones_), Severus Snape (_Harry Potter_), and Agent Smith (_The Matrix_).

**Character Information**  
**_Persona._** To the world, Rahadin is [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s loyal right-hand man and merciless enforcer. Only Rahadin knows the depths of his dedication to the Von Zarovich family, who he believes saved him from shame and despair.

**_Morale._** In a fight, Rahadin would immediately draw his weapons and softly offer his opponent an opportunity to stand down—then attack mercilessly and with every strategic advantage if denied.

**_Relationships._** Rahadin is the chamberlain of [[Castle Ravenloft]], the adopted brother of [[Strahd von Zarovich]], the cousin of the dusk elf [[Kasimir Velikov]], the son of the late dusk elf prince [[Erevan Löwenhart]] (the original owner of the blade that would later become the _Sunsword_), and the killer of the dusk elf women (excepting the **banshee** [[Patrina Velikov]], who was killed by her brother [[Kasimir Velikov|Kasimir]]).
