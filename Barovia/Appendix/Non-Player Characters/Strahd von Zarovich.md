# Roleplaying Strahd
Strahd is cold and calculating, skilled in social manipulation and deception. As the adventure unfolds, his attitude toward the players shifts significantly. Though Strahd never conceals his nature or identity, this dynamic relationship manifests as three "roles" that he plays:

The Gentleman, the Tyrant, and the Monster.
## The Gentleman
---
When the players first enter Barovia, Strahd acts as the Gentleman—polished and poised, if somewhat sociopathic. He is welcoming, well-mannered, and insatiably curious.

**His goal**—to learn the ins and outs of the players' minds, including their goals, strengths, and weaknesses.

As the Gentleman, Strahd should flatter the players with his interest and curiosity, offend them with his arrogance and condescension, and disgust them with his disregard for human freedom.

In this role, Strahd most often feels curious, amused, nostalgic, or disappointed.
Consider channeling Hannibal Lecter (_The Silence of the Lambs_), Don Corleone (_The Godfather_), or Frank Underwood (_House of Cards_) when playing him.

The Gentleman avoids clashes as much as he can, taking any player rudeness or defiance in stride. If pushed, he might send his minions to stop a player's physical attacks, but only as a last resort.
## The Tyrant 
---
When he learns that the players have relit the Beacon of Argynvostholt at the conclusion [[Arc Q - A Shining Beacon]], Strahd becomes the Tyrant—harsh, stern, and somewhat cruel. He keeps his cool and aloof demeanour, but treats the players less like guests and more like disappointing protégés. 

**His goal**—to push the players to their limits, testing their resilience and assessing their competence.

As the Tyrant, Strahd should offend the players with his insults and condescension, and disgust them with his disregard for human life.

In this role, Strahd most often feels disappointed, scornful, satisfied, amused, and contemptuous. 
Consider channelling Moriarty (_Sherlock_), Tywin Lannister (_Game of Thrones_), Severus Snape (_Harry Potter_), and Omni-Man (_Invincible_).

The Tyrant never strikes first—but will dare defiant players to back their words with action. Should a player back down, Strahd mocks their resolve and capabilities. Any players who attack him, though, are met with a swift and ruthless response—though never a lethal one.
## The Monster 
---
When he first learns that the players have restored the blade of [[The Sunsword]] in [[Arc S - The Sword of Sunlight]], Strahd abandons all pretense and becomes the Monster—a cold, unfeeling sociopath, described further in **Roleplaying Strahd** (found here).

**His goal**—to achieve his goals, no matter the cost.

As the Monster, Strahd should disgust the players with his complete indifference to life and death, inspire pity for his inability to feel happiness or love, and frustrate the players with his refusal to ever lose his cool.

In this role, Strahd most often feels indifferent, curious, satisfied, and determined. Consider channeling Stan Edgar (_The Boys_), Gus Fring (_Breaking Bad_), and Thanos (_Avengers: Endgame_).

The Monster crushes any resistance ruthlessly and efficiently. Though he can't be provoked, he's too proud to ever flee from a fight.
## How to Enjoy Roleplaying Strahd
---
Strahd can be a challenging and anxiety-inducing villain to roleplay. To enjoy the experience, rather than dreading it, consider the following tips:

- **Enjoy Invincibility.** Strahd is the one NPC in the entire campaign that (until they obtain the _Sunsword_) your players cannot hurt in any meaningful way. Their strongest attacks do little more than tickle him. Their cruellest insults merely amuse him. Enter Strahd-related scenes without fear of player action.
- **Embrace Unpredictability.** In each scene before [[Arc R - Trials of the Mountain]], Strahd has no particular goal, and won't be disappointed if events unfold differently than he expected. Release any obligation you feel to make the scene conclude in a particular way.
- **Explore Darkness.** Strahd provides a risk-free opportunity to explore and relish darker emotions, such as (justified) arrogance, (quiet) cruelty, and (subtle) contempt. Savour those emotions and the impact they have on your players.
# Strahd's Relationships 
Strahd has a complex web of relationships with the denizens of Barovia, many of which are described below.
### [[Arc A - Escape from Death House#A2. Death House|Death House.]]
Strahd views the cult of [[Arc A - Escape from Death House#A2. Death House|Death House.]] with respectful disdain; he finds their methods and obsessions distasteful, but appreciates their efforts to bring worthy consorts and adversaries from the lands beyond the Mists.
### [[The Village of Barovia|Village of Barovia.]]
Strahd believes, without romance or obsession, that [[Ireena Kolyana]]’s body is the host for [[Tatyana Federovna|Tatyana]]’s soul, and that [[Tatyana Federovna|Tatyana]]’s soul belongs to him. Through his spies, he is aware of [[Ismark Kolyanovich]]’s position and relationship to [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], but finds him to be a lacklustre leader and a half-rate swordsman. He views [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] and [[Doru]] with scorn, disdaining the convictions, pride, and faith that [[Doru]] had in life.
### [[Arc C - Into the Valley#C4. Tser Pool|Tser Pool Encampment.]]
Strahd finds [[Madam Eva]] a fascinating enigma, but has come to an unspoken understanding with her: she shall read his fortune whenever he requests it, and, in exchange, he will not delve too deeply into her history or affairs.
### Old Bonegrinder
Strahd is aware of the **night hag** coven’s presence, but has little interest in their affairs.
### Town of Vallaki.
Strahd has no interest in [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich]], but, through his spies, believes him to be a bumbling fool. He finds [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] to be a useful agent and favours her for her family’s history of loyalty, but cares little for her obsession with Vallakian politics. He is aware of the existence of the [[Keepers of the Feather]] (though not that the Blue Water Inn serves as their meeting-place), but does not view them as a significant threat.
### Vistani Encampment.
Strahd holds [[Arrigal]] as one of his favoured spies. However, he pays little mind to the dusk elves—Kasimir especially—and has little interest in their affairs.
### Argynvostholt. 
Strahd views the **revenants** of [[the Order of the Silver Dragon]] with disinterested contempt, but has long since determined that the knights pose no threat to him, and has largely ignored them as a result. He has heard the rumours that [[Argynvost]]’s spirit haunts the manor, but pays them no mind; he would refuse to believe that the beacon of Argynvostholt could be relit even if told to his face.
### Wizard of Wines. 
Strahd is aware that the winery is a stronghold for the [[Keepers of the Feather]], but does not view them as a significant threat. He has delegated their “discipline” to Ludmilla, ensuring that their insubordination and resistance will be properly punished.
### Yester Hill. 
Strahd views the Forest Folk with disdain and some amusement. He finds their maddened worship to be more grating than gratifying, and views the modern generation as a poor shadow of their more distinguished forebears. He does find them to be useful tools, however, and knows that their “faith” is a necessary evil to ensure their continued loyalty.
### Village of Krezk. 
Strahd has little interest in [[Burgomaster Dmitri Krezkov]] or the people of [[The Village of Krezk|Krezk]]. He is, amused by the Abbot’s descent into madness and corruption. He intends to temporarily “play along” with the Abbot’s efforts to construct a **flesh golem** bride for him, but has no serious intention of accepting Vasilka when complete.
### Werewolf Den. 
Strahd finds Kiril Stoyanovich to be a useful and loyal servant, if somewhat brutish and unsophisticated. He intends to keep Emil Toranescu, the pack’s former alpha, as a prisoner in his dungeons until Emil is sufficiently mad with starvation to be “tamed.”
### Tsolenka Pass. 
Strahd is peripherally aware that the Mountain Folk roam the Balinok Mountains, but—due to Elder Burebis’s protection—is unaware of the existence of their settlement Soldav. He considers the Mountain Folk to be a lost and broken people and has no use for or interest in them.
### Amber Temple. 
Strahd respects Neferon’s dedication to protecting the temple and finds him to be a worthy guardian of the treasures contained within. He has historically had a collegial respect for Exethanter, but, after awakening from his own hibernation, was disappointed by Exethanter’s loss of memory—something Strahd has little interest in restoring.
### Castle Ravenloft. 
Strahd is amused by the efforts of his brides—[[Ludmilla Vilisevic]], [[Anastrasya Karelova]], and [[Volenta Popfsky]]—to placate and impress him. He is momentarily entertained by his newest consort, [[Escher]], but has been distracted lately by other, grander designs. He views [[Rahadin]] as his most loyal, trusted, and favoured servant, but spares little mind to the other staff and occupants of the castle, including [[Cyrus Belview]], [[Lief Lipsiege]], the coven of witches, and his own vampire spawn. By contrast, [[Beucephalus]] is his favoured “pet” and most valued tool.
# Strahd’s Goals 
Strahd’s primary goal is simple: to free himself and Barovia from the Mists.

As a conqueror, Strahd craves new lands and the freedom—and power—to claim them. He seeks to restore his long-lost empire, with [[Castle Ravenloft]] and the valley of Barovia as its seat of power.

To this end, he needs three things: a pacified kingdom, a host of loyal servants, and—most importantly—an escape plan.

By defeating his servants and halting their schemes, the players can deny him the first; by defending [[Ireena Kolyana]] and resisting his temptations, they can also deny him the second. However, Strahd has plans within plans, and there is only one way to halt his final scheme: to destroy the vampire himself.
## Reclaiming the Valley 
---
When Strahd awoke from his century-long slumber, he found that much had changed.

The people of Barovia had forgotten why they feared him, and their burgomasters no longer served him faithfully. His servants and consorts had dispersed across the valley in pursuit of their own schemes and whims, and the wilds themselves had somehow cleansed the stain of corruption.

That, he knew, must be addressed.

He moved quickly to reclaim the [[Forest Fane]] as his own, restoring its bond to the [[Heart of Sorrow]] once more. He bade [[Rahadin]] to find staff and attendants for [[Castle Ravenloft]], and to ensure that each of the keep’s occupants served their master’s will. And he summoned his brides and spawn to [[Castle Ravenloft]], commanding them to spread his shadow across the valley once more.

Since then, Strahd has broken [[the village of Barovia]] and brought the werewolf pack to heel. He seeks next to break [[the town of Vallaki]] and [[the village of Krezk]], to discipline the so-called “[[Keepers of the Feather]],” and to capture the vampire hunter [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten]].

When his servants’ work is done, Strahd expects to look down from the Pillarstone of [[Castle Ravenloft|Ravenloft]] upon a faithful and fearful populace, its people subservient to the Devil of [[Castle Ravenloft]] once more.
## Renewing His Servants 
---
When Strahd awoke from his slumber, he found that many of his vampiric brides and other servants had dispersed across the valley, forgoing his dark will in favour of their own petty pursuits. He has quickly moved to correct this—but some doubts still remain.

Strahd seeks assurances that, when he escapes Barovia, he will do so with an army that will heed his words and execute his will without error or hesitation. To this end, he has delegated many of his plots to reassert his authority to his servants. Should they succeed, they shall be exalted and placed in positions of authority beneath him; should they fail, they shall be locked in the crypts beneath [[Castle Ravenloft|Ravenloft]] for eternity.

Strahd is always hungry for new talent, however, and is on the lookout for new generals to serve his conquests and fresh consorts to keep him entertained. When the players arrive in Barovia, he focuses his attention on those who are especially charismatic, arrogant, intelligent, cunning, or attractive, seeking to determine whether any among the party are worthy of serving him in undeath.

Though Strahd has not said so expressly, his brides are well-aware of the risk of being replaced—a motivation that he hopes will fuel their efforts on his behalf.  
Strahd believes fully in the “survival of the fittest” and expects to see the strongest rise to the top.
## Escaping the Mists 
---
With [[Madam Eva]]’s reluctant guidance, Strahd has learned that the [[Grand Conjunction]]—a time when the barriers between worlds will be thinned, and the energies of the stars aligned—is a prime opportunity to free himself from the Dark Powers’ prison.

To this end, Strahd has crafted an ambitious and dangerous ritual to escape the Mists, using the [[Heart of Sorrow]] as its conduit and anchor. This ritual has four necessary components: a power source, a control mechanism, a catalyst, and a sacrifice.

### The Power Source.
Strahd’s plan requires a substantial amount of power—far more than he can supply himself. So long as he remains bonded to the Fanes of Barovia, however, he can channel their power directly into the [[Heart of Sorrow]] for use in the ritual.

Using the Fanes in the ritual will also allow Strahd to bring the valley itself—and all of its inhabitants—along with him to the Material Plane. Given that Barovia was his final conquest and the centerpiece of his power, Strahd will not relinquish it so easily.
### The Control Mechanism.
The raw power of the leylines beneath the Fanes is wild and near-impossible to control. Even as their master, only a token of the Ladies’ divinity can allow Strahd to direct them. He has recently learned that a child with the blood of the [[Seeker]] resides somewhere within the valley—the [[Vistani|Vistana]] [[Arabelle]], though Strahd does not yet know her name—and has directed his spies to locate and capture her.

Should this plot fail, Strahd must instead journey to the Whispering Wall at Yester Hill and make a sacrifice of great personal value—his **animated armor**, the symbol of his early conquests and might—exchanging a piece of his past for a promise of his future.
### The Catalyst.
Power and control are all well and good. In order to break through a wall, however, all good conquerors need a point of attack. To this end, Strahd plans to forge a battering ram capable of piercing through [[Mists of Ravenloft|the Mists]]—a siege weapon forged from the souls of the Barovians themselves.

[[Mists of Ravenloft|The Mists]], as creations of the [[Dark Powers]], are born of apathy, fear, and despair. To escape [[Mists of Ravenloft|the Mists]] without drawing their ire, therefore, Strahd intends to surround the [[Heart of Sorrow]] with a shell of wailing, hopeless souls. He believes that, by brutally reasserting his dominion over Barovia, his subjects will lose themselves to fear and despair, darkening their souls to meet his needs.

By consuming the Barovians’ souls, Strahd can also use the energies of his escape to repurpose their soulless husks as undead soldiers, forging a new army for his conquests to come. The sole exception includes [[Ireena Kolyana]], who Strahd will allow to keep her soul for his own purposes.
### The Sacrifice.
The schemes of the [[Dark Powers]] command that a Darklord must always sit upon the throne of [[Castle Ravenloft]]. To escape their clutches, Strahd must find a suitable replacement—an individual whose soul is stained with evil—and sacrifice them as his scapegoat, their soul offered to the [[Dark Powers]] as Strahd makes his escape.

Strahd's chamberlain and adoptive brother, [[Rahadin]], has willingly offered himself as a worthy replacement. However, should Strahd find another suitable candidate, he would leap at the opportunity to retain [[Rahadin]]'s services as a general for his armies.
### Plans Within Plans.
If the players reconsecrate the Fanes, Strahd quickly devises a backup plan. By becoming the champions of the Fanes, the players will unknowingly have made themselves into conduits for their power, allowing Strahd to access the Fanes’ energies if he can lure the players to [[Castle Ravenloft]].

He can do this by using the power stored in the [[Heart of Sorrow]] to plunge Barovia into eternal night, raising the deceased from their graves and sending a plague of undead against Barovia’s settlements—a siege that will end only if Strahd himself is defeated. As a bonus, Strahd believes that this undead apocalypse will surely drive the Barovians into fear and despair, counteracting the players' efforts to bring hope to the valley.
# Strahd's Allies
Strahd commands a vast host of beasts, undead, and other minions, which he can direct in a host of plots or schemes. They include:

- **_[[Rahadin]],_** Strahd’s dusk elf chamberlain
- **_[[Beucephalus]],_** Strahd’s **nightmare** steed
- **_Strahd’s vampiric brides,_** [[Ludmilla Vilisevic|Ludmilla]], [[Anastrasya Karelova|Anastrasya]], and [[Volenta Popofsky|Volenta]]
- **_Strahd’s vampire spawn,_** including his consort, [[Escher]]
- **_Undead servants,_** including **zombies**, **Strahd zombies**, and **wights**
- **_Loyal beasts,_** including Barovian bats, rats, wolves, and **dire wolves**
- **_The werewolf pack_** commanded by [[Kiril Stoyanovich]]
- **_Vistani spies_**, including Eliza (at [[Arc C - Into the Valley#C4. Tser Pool|Tser Pool]] Encampment) and [[Arrigal]] (at the Vallaki encampment)
- **_The witches’ coven_** that dwells in [[Castle Ravenloft]]

However, Strahd **always faces the final battle alone.** Whether by pride, fate, or mere coincidence, this fight is his to win—or lose.

> [!info]- Strahd's Spawn
> Strahd's **vampire spawn**, as noted in Vampire Spawn (Monster Manual, p. 298), are bound by two compulsions: their hunger for blood, and the need to obey any command Strahd gives them. Only the strongest-willed spawn can master their need for blood, but no spawn can ignore one of Strahd's direct orders. Even so, while all of Strahd's spawn are bound to obey the letter of his commands, intelligent and wilful spawn may find opportunities to disobey their spirit.
# Strahd's Tactics
Even in combat, Strahd is no ordinary foe. Like several of the enemies encountered in this adventure, he uses a **multi-phase statblock** in battle. Strahd’s statistics work as follows:
### Phases 
Strahd's combat statistics include three phases: the Mage, the Soldier, and the Vampire. Each phase has its own unique features, abilities, **and an independent pool of hit points.** (For example, damage dealt to the Soldier phase doesn’t carry over to the Mage phase.)

Strahd can choose which phase he begins in when rolling initiative. By default, his starting phase is the Mage.

When outside of combat, Strahd can:

- switch into his Soldier phase by drawing his longsword and extinguishing his focus;
- switch into his Mage phase by lighting his focus (his cloak's ruby clasp) and stowing his longsword;
- switch into his Vampire phase by stowing his longsword and extinguishing his focus.
### Phase Transitions 
When a phase is reduced to 0 hit points, Strahd’s statistics are immediately replaced by the statistics of another phase (your choice). **When this happens, all conditions afflicting Strahd end.** (For example, if Strahd was prone or paralyzed, he is no longer prone or paralyzed.) Damage dealt to one phase does not carry over to the next.

By default, Strahd's second phase is the **Soldier**, and his third phase is the **Vampire**. When Strahd enters his second phase, his eyes glow crimson red and his fingernails lengthen and harden. When Strahd enters his third phase, his fangs grow longer and sharper, and his nostrils become batlike slits.

A phase reduced to 0 hit points can’t be used again until Strahd completes a long rest in his coffin.
### Defeat 
If all three phases are reduced to 0 hit points, Strahd transforms into a cloud of mist instead of falling unconscious, provided that he isn't in running water or sunlight. **If he can't transform, he is destroyed.**

While transformed in this way, he has a fly speed of 30 feet, can hover, and has immunity to all damage, except the damage he takes from sunlight. He must reach his coffin within 2 hours or be destroyed. Once in his coffin, he reverts to his vampire form. He is then paralyzed until he regains at least 1 hit point. After 1 hour in his coffin with 0 hit points, he regains 1 hit point.
### Attributes & Weaknesses 
All three phases share the following vampire attributes and weaknesses:

- _Undead Nature._ Strahd doesn't require air.
- _Forbiddance._ Strahd can't enter a residence without an invitation from one of the occupants.
- _Chained to the Grave._ Strahd cannot gain the benefits of a long rest except by resting in his coffin for eight consecutive hours between dawn and dusk.
- _Children of the Night._ Strahd can comprehend and verbally communicate with Barovian bats, rats, and wolves (including **dire wolves**), which obey his commands.
- _Stake to the Heart._ If a piercing weapon made of wood is driven into Strahd’s heart while he is incapacitated in his coffin, he is paralyzed until the stake is removed.

Additionally, Strahd can use the following action in his **_Vampire_** form:

- **_Shapechange._** If Strahd isn't in running water or sunlight, he polymorphs into a Tiny **bat**, a Medium **wolf**, or a Medium cloud of mist, or back into his true form. His statistics, other than his size and speed, are unchanged. Anything he is wearing transforms with him, but nothing he is carrying does. He reverts to his true form if he dies. While in mist form, Strahd can't take any actions, speak, or manipulate objects. He is weightless, has a flying speed of 30 feet, can hover, and can enter a hostile creature's space and stop there. In addition, if air can pass through a space, the mist can do so without squeezing, and he can't pass through water. He has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws, and he is immune to all nonmagical damage, except the damage he takes from sunlight.

While Strahd retains a connection to the Fanes of Barovia, he also possesses the following features in all three phases:

- **_Dominion of the Mountain._** While Strahd retains the power of the Mountain Fane, he is under the effect of a permanent _nondetection_ spell.
- **_Dominion of the Swamp._** While Strahd retains the power of the Swamp Fane, he can cast _major image_ and _move earth_ without components.
- **_Dominion of the Forest._** While Strahd retains the power of the Forest Fane, he can cast _beast sense_ and _locate creature_ without components.
- **_Rejuvenation._** If Strahd is destroyed while he retains the power of at least one of the Fanes, he gains a new body in 24 hours, regaining all his hit points and phases and becoming active again. His new body appears within his coffin.

> [!info]- Vampiric Forbiddance
> When deciding whether and how Strahd's **_Forbiddance_** feature applies, use the following definitions:
> 
> - A **residence** is a place of residence that is not generally open to the public, including houses, apartments, cabins, and even certain types of rooms within a larger building, like an inn or church, provided they are used for living purposes and offer some degree of privacy. The definition does not include public places like taverns, shops, streets, or town squares.
> 
> - An **occupant** is an individual who expects to reside in the dwelling indefinitely, or a guest of such an individual. This person must have some claim to the space, such as by being a homeowner, renter, tenant, or guest of one of the aforementioned.
> 
> Remember that an occupant charmed by the **_charm_** ability of Strahd’s Vampire phase will gladly invite him to enter if asked.

# Design Notes: Strahd Von Zarovich
**_Roleplaying Strahd._** The Gentleman, the Tyrant, and the Monster reflect three distinct popular community interpretations of Strahd's character. Many DMs will attempt to combine two or more of these archetypes into their campaign at a time, but doing so can risk making Strahd's character feel inconsistent and unpredictable.

As such, this section provides a structured, methodical approach to developing Strahd's character through his relationship with the players. Importantly, each transition is tied to a particular point in the adventure's timeline, ensuring that Strahd does not, for example, spoil his relationship with the players before inviting them to dinner, or treat them as enemies before they have the capacity to defend themselves.

**_Strahd's Relationships._** This section preserves Strahd's canonical relationship with [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] in order to keep his (cold, calculating, and sociopathic) characterization consistent.

**_Strahd's Goals._** This section is structured to ensure a high-tension, action-packed sequence of challenges from the beginning to the end of the campaign. Specifically, it explains:

- why Strahd does not simply seize [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] from the players (he fears the Dark Powers’ intervention if he does not escape Barovia first);
- why Strahd’s forces are attacking St. Andral’s Church and the Wizard of Wines winery (he seeks to break the [[Barovians]]’ spirit to fuel his escape ritual);
- why Strahd does not assist his forces in defeating the players at St. Andral’s Church or the Wizard of Wines winery (he seeks to separate the weak from the strong);
- why Strahd “tests” the players instead of killing them (he wants to find generals for his future armies);
- why the players must reconsecrate the Fanes (they must stop Strahd from using them in his ritual and remove Strahd's immortality);
- why Strahd does not simply kill the players when they reconsecrate the Fanes (he seeks to use them as alternate conduits to the Fanes);
- why the players cannot bring an army of allies to [[Castle Ravenloft]] (they are preoccupied defending their homes from Strahd’s undead apocalypse); and
- why the players must confront Strahd at [[Castle Ravenloft]] (they must do so to end his undead apocalypse).

**_Strahd's Allies._** For reasons of both balance and narrative, it is important that Strahd faces the final fight alone.

**_Strahd's Tactics._** Strahd's original statblock is exceptionally fragile, allowing players to destroy him _without_ the Sunsword as early as level 6. His **_phasing_** lair action, however, turns the original final battle into a torturous slog, ensuring that the players cannot win unless the Dungeon Master allows it or makes a mistake.

Many substitute statblocks have been proposed, increasing Strahd's Challenge Rating beyond his original difficulty. However, these strengthened statblocks fail for two simple reasons:

- Any Strahd statblock that is powerful enough to survive the players' attacks for more than three rounds is also powerful enough to knock players unconscious with a single attack, thereby starting a "death spiral" that kills the entire party.
- Any Strahd statblock that is unable to knock players unconscious with a single attack is fragile and must rely on hit-and-run guerilla tactics instead, disappointing and frustrating players who had rightfully expected an epic confrontation.

This issue can be solved by dramatically increasing Strahd's hit points and/or Armor Class (i.e., "Defensive Challenge Rating") while dramatically decreasing his attack bonus and/or damage output (i.e., "Offensive Challenge Rating"). These changes dramatically increase his lifespan without risking a TPK, ensuring a long, yet winnable boss battle

Long battles, however, leave players exhausted and bored—especially for playgroups whose combats run slow. To inject energy and dynamism into the fight, we can split Strahd's statblock into three parts, or "phases," with each phase bestowing Strahd with new abilities and features. Each phase has been calibrated using [Challenge Ratings 2.0](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-N4m46K77hpMVnh7upYa) to survive approximately three to four rounds against an average 10th-level party wielding the _Sunsword_ and _Holy Symbol of Ravenkind_ and accompanied by Ezmerelda d'Avenir, Ireena Kolyana, and Kasimir Velikov; the entire combat encounter should last nine to twelve rounds in total.

To strengthen the themes of the final fight, each phase reflects a part of Strahd's history and descent into darkness: the Soldier (reflecting his history as a conqueror); the Mage (reflecting his search for immortality); and the Monster (reflecting his passage into undeath).

Even with a multi-phase statblock, however, Strahd's battlefield remains relatively stagnant. To introduce additional tactics and dynamics into the fight, each of Strahd's phases have been given the following: two attack options (for moving enemies and imposing conditions, respectively); two bonus attack options (for punishing short- and long-range foes, respectively); and two reaction options (for escaping and aggressing, respectively).

Strahd's legendary actions have also been replaced with the ability to take multiple reactions per round, maintaining his ability to react to changing circumstances while reducing memory issues for the DM.

Note that the Mage statblock intentionally foregoes a traditional "spellcasting" feature in favor of an action-oriented selection of spells. While some DMs might be disappointed by Strahd's lack of choice, it is important to remember that each phase will survive for only a short period of time; as such, Strahd's spells have been carefully curated in order to provide players with the most challenging, tactical, and memorable experience possible.

**_Vampire Forbiddance._** Tension is the key to horror, and monsters are therefore scary only when bound by meaningful rules. Permitting Strahd to enter any home simply because “he is the Land” removes the players’ ability to meaningfully prevent it, thereby removing a large amount of suspenseful gameplay.

Moreover, a monster is only as resonant as its most notable weaknesses; a werewolf that cannot be killed with silver, for example, is hardly a werewolf at all. Removing Strahd’s _Forbiddance_ destroys a key part of the horror fantasy: the ability to defy a monster using its unique rules and weaknesses. As such, this guide intentionally retains that feature.
