**Roleplaying Information**  
**_Resonance._** Father Petrovich should inspire gratitude with his hospitality, flattery with his willingness to listen and empathize, comfort with his warmth, serenity, and wisdom, and sympathy for his anxiety regarding the missing bones and the safety of his congregation.

**_Emotions._** Father Petrovich’s most frequent emotions are thoughtfulness, hopefulness, concern, and compassion.

**_Motivations._** Father Petrovich wants to keep Vallaki's spirits up, to keep the church a place of sanctuary and comfort, and to raise Yeska as best as he can.

**_Inspirations._** When playing Father Petrovich, channel Uncle Iroh (_Avatar: The Last Airbender_), Michael Carpenter and Father Forthill (_The Dresden Files_), and Mr. Rogers (_Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood_).

**Character Information**  
**_Persona._** To strangers, Father Petrovich is a serene, humble, and compassionate priest who is always happy to share a word of praise or a few pearls of wisdom. To those he trusts, Father Petrovich is a dedicated and stalwart defender of his community, who nonetheless worries about his ability to keep his congregants safe. Deep down, Father Petrovich harbors a twinge of doubt about the Morninglord's providence and power, wondering if Strahd's awakening is a test of Barovians' faith or a sign that the land is forsaken forever.

**_Morale._** In a fight, Father Petrovich would prefer to dissuade his attackers, surrendering peacefully if necessary to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. However, if an innocent life or the members of his congregation were threatened, he would fight to the death with a prayer on his lips and peace in his heart.

**_Relationships._** Father Petrovich is a mentor and father figure to the orphan and altar boy Yeska, the employer of the groundskeeper [[Milivoj]], the brother of Baroness Lydia Petrovna, and the distant descendant of Tasha Petrovna, an ancient cleric of the Morninglord whose remains are kept in the catacombs of Castle Ravenloft.
