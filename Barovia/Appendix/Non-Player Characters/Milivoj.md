**Roleplaying Information**  
**_Resonance._** Milivoj should inspire scorn with his gruff, cynical, and stubborn personality, sympathy for his frustration at his parents' addiction to dream pastries, and endearment to him for his wholehearted dedication to provide for his siblings, no matter the cost to himself.

**_Emotions._** Milivoj's most frequent emotions are annoyance, worry, frustration, boredom, bitterness, and cynicism, and (when with his siblings) compassion, mirth, and joy.

**_Motivations._** Milivoj wants to provide for himself and his siblings.

**_Inspirations._** When playing Milivoj, channel Katniss Everdeen (_The Hunger Games_), Arya Stark (_Game of Thrones_), and Carl Fredericksen (_Up_).

**Character Information**  
**_Persona._** To strangers, Milivoj is a quiet, gruff, and hardworking groundskeeper. To those he trusts, Milivoj is a loving and dedicated elder sibling, a frustrated and bitter son, and a desperate and confused young man.

**_Morale._** In a fight, Milivoj would brandish his shovel in an attempt to get his attacker to back down, but would quickly surrender if seriously wounded. (If defending his siblings, however, Milivoj would fiercely and gladly fight to the death.)

**_Relationships._** Milivoj is employed by [[Father Lucian Petrovich]], secretly works for the coffin maker [[Henrik van der Voort]], and is the eldest of nine children belonging to Oleg and Jarzinka, two dream pastry-addicted [[Vallakians]].
