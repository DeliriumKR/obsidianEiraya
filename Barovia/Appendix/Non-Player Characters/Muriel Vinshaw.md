**_Regeneration._** Muriel regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn if she hasn't taken necrotic damage or bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage from a silvered weapon since her last turn.

**_Mimic._** Muriel can mimic simple sounds she has heard, such as a person whispering, a baby crying, or an animal chittering. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Insight) check.

**_Plummet._** If Muriel flies at least 20 feet straight toward a target while descending at least five feet toward the ground, and then hits that target with a shortsword attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 7 (2d6) piercing damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 12 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

### Actions

**_Multiattack._** Muriel makes two weapon attacks, one of which can be with her hand crossbow.

**_Shortsword._** (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only) _Melee Weapon Attack_: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

**_Hand Crossbow._** (Humanoid or Hybrid Form Only) _Ranged Weapon Attack_: +5 to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.

**_Beak._** (Raven or Hybrid Form Only) _Melee Weapon Attack_: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 1 piercing damage in raven form, or 5 (1d4 + 3) piercing damage in hybrid form. If the target is humanoid, it must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with wereraven lycanthropy.

### Bonus Actions

**_Shapechange._** Muriel polymorphs into a raven-humanoid hybrid or into a raven, or back into her human form. Her statistics, other than her size, are the same in each form. Any equipment she is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. She reverts to her human form if she dies.

### Reactions

**_Interpose._** When a creature Muriel can see hits another target within 5 feet of Muriel with an attack, she can use her reaction to take the damage instead.
