Found in [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia]].

**Roleplaying Information**  
**_Resonance._** Donavich should inspire sympathy for his sorrow and fears, pity for his separation from the [[Church of the Morninglord|Church of the Morninglord]], endearment for his kindness and hospitality, and discomfort for his zealous condemnation of Doru’s undead nature.

**_Emotions._** In his current state, Donavich most often feels grief, guilt, exhaustion, compassion, and obsession. If reconciled with Doru, he most often feels hope, relief, gratitude, confusion, fear, and shame.

**_Motivations._** Father Donavich wants to free his son from [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s clutches—at any cost.

**_Inspirations._** When playing Father Donavich, channel Eddard Stark (Game of Thrones), Walter White (Breaking Bad), and Denethor (The Lord of the Rings).

**Character Information**  
**_Persona._** To the world, Father Donavich is a grieving, yet zealous father. To those he trusts, Donavich is a broken man adrift in the world, lost and confused without guidance or purpose.

**_Morale._** In a fight, Father Donavich would ordinarily fight to defend his people and church. In his current state, however, he would immediately surrender, too wracked with guilt to even defend his own life.

**_Relationships._** Father Donavich is Doru’s father and the priest of the Barovian church.
