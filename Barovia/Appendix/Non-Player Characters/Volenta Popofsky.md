**Roleplaying Information**  
**_Resonance._** Volenta should inspire revulsion with her obsession with pain and gore, discomfort with her sadistic and psychotic personality, and a strange sort of flattery with her flirtatious—if eccentric—attitude.

**_Emotions._** Volenta most often feels amused, curious, irritated, bored, fascinated, enraged, and gleeful.

**_Motivations._** Volenta wants to impress Strahd and earn her place as foremost among his brides, to satisfy her frequent sadistic urges, and to find novel ways to cause suffering and pain through tinkering and innovation.

**_Inspirations._** When playing Volenta, channel Jinx (_Arcane_), Ty Lee (_Avatar: The Last Airbender_), and Harley Quinn (_Batman_).

**Character Information**

**_Persona._** To strangers, Volenta is a manic, impulsive, and trigger-happy sadist with a flair for invention and innovation.

**_Morale._** In a fight, Volenta would gleefully relish the opportunity to test her custom-made weapons on hostile subjects—and, when pushed far enough, to tear those subjects apart with her bare hands and teeth.

**_Relationships._** Volenta is fanatically loyal to Strahd von Zarovich, and views his other brides and consorts—especially Anastrasya, Ludmilla, and Escher—with deep resentment, jealousy, and suspicion.
