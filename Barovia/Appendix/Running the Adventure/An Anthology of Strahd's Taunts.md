As part of the party's adventure log, I included Strahd's portrait and a randomly generated caption. That way, after every session, the players still feel something of Strahd's presence and personality. In addition to those I wrote myself, I pulled this list of quotes from _I, Strahd_, _Dracula, Frankenstein_, and a number of other sources—I even adapted a few from serial killer interviews. I dunno if the players get a kick out of the quotes or not (or if they've even noticed them haha), but sometimes reading through the lists gets me in the right frame of mind to voice him. Figured I'd share what I have in case others find it useful:

For those of you who are looking for an easier way to peruse the list or just want to roll a random quote, I put together this [Discourse of Strahd generator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18W5EyugLxzNNtiAXY8DGHxpi3lsYfIpXUbCOs5ORoiM/edit?usp=sharing) in google sheets. 
Just go to `File` > `Make a Copy` and click the image to generate a new quote (you will need to give the macro permission to run). Enjoy!

|      2      |                     A rich man thinks all others are rich, and an intelligent man thinks all others are similarly gifted. Both are terribly shocked when they discover the truth of the world.                     |
|      3      |                                                                          A thousand nights, a thousand years lay before me. Without her.                                                                           |
|      4      |                       According to popular legend, an eager student once attempted to summon some form of invisible servant. When it came, thing was invisible all right—and rather hungry.                        |
|      5      |                                        Ah, it is the fault of our knowledge that it wants to explain all; and if it explain not, then it says there is nothing to explain.                                         |

|      7      |                                                                            All succumb to the shadows of Barovia; you are no different.                                                                            |
|      8      |                                           Along with the sharp joy of love, I was being cut in twain by the razor edge of despair, and I was unable to conceal the pain.                                           |
|      9      |                                       And so you, like the others, would play your brains against mine. You would help these men to hunt me and frustrate me in my designs!                                        |
|     10      |                                                                                       And the hunt for my successor goes on.                                                                                       |

|     12      |                          And you are now to me flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood, kin of my kin; my bountiful wine-press for awhile; and shall later on be my companion and my helper.                          |
|     13      |                                                                And, to my bitter grief, with a shock and in silence, he died, a gallant gentleman.                                                                 |
|     14      |                       Any other time, they would have put me to the sword—the standard fate of a thief in this land—but as final arbiter of my own laws, I could make changes as I saw fit.                        |
|     15      |                                            As age had been eliminated for me, only death remained, measured out in palatable doses that lasted from sunrise to sunset.                                             |
|     16      |                                                As she approached, I came to see that she was as beyond beauty as a river in spring flood is beyond a drop of water.                                                |
|     17      |         As surrender had been, so was black despair once an alient concept to me. Now I was as familiar with both as with my own features, for there they were in my mirror, gazing back at me every day.          |
|     18      |                                                                           Be welcome and look upon this as your true home, forevermore.                                                                            |

|     21      |                                                                       Blood warms the heart. It’s like mulled wine, but with more screaming.                                                                       |
|     22      |                                                  Blood. A fountain of it. Life. If I dared to take it. As my own life ebbed, I dared not refuse. I drank. Deeply.                                                  |
|     23      |                                                                                    Bravo! I have long been a lover of tragedy.                                                                                     |

|     25      |                                  But hers was the misery of innocence, which, like a cloud that passes over the fair moon, for a while hides, but cannot tarnish its brightness.                                   |
|     26      |  By trial and error, I learned just how much to take to feed myself, yet not kill. There was no mercy in my self-discipline, only hunger—for over-indulgence would have quickly deprived me of a stocked larder.   |
|     27      |                                                                         Careful, now. If killing has not satisfied you yet, it never will.                                                                         |

|     39      |                    Do you believe in destiny? That even the powers of time can be altered for a single purpose? That the luckiest man who walks on this earth is the one who finds… true love?                     |
|     40      |                                                                              Do you feel remorse? I never quite grasped its utility.                                                                               |

|     43      |                                       Do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand, and yet which are; that some people see things that others cannot?                                       |
|     44      |                                             Doctor, you don’t know what it is to doubt everything, even yourself. No, you don’t; you couldn’t with a soul like yours.                                              |

|     52      |                  For a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears; but the iron had eaten into my flesh, and I sank again, trembling and hopeless, into my miserable self.                  |

|     58      |                                           He still lived, but was too far lost for awareness. He could not have felt it as I dragged the edge firmly across his throat.                                            |

|     60      |                          Her returning smile was like that first glimpse of sun after a bitter winter. All I wanted to do for the rest of my life was keep that smile on her ever after.                           |
|     61      |                                             His blood races through me like wind and fire, like the hot rage of battle, with its delirious blending of terror and joy.                                             |

|     66      |                                  How many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb!                                   |
|     67      |                  Human desires being what they are, one would think the ritual for casting a love-spell or creating a love-philter would be more common, but my books were bereft of such things.                  |

|     78      |                                         I could not die, but they would. Before another hour passed, I would send them wailing on their way to rotting hell. All of them.                                          |
|     79      |                               I don’t want the people believing they can just drop their tools and make merry whenever it pleases them, or we’ll have no end of holidays to endure.                                |
|     80      |                                                         I expect my subjects to be honest in their dealings with each other, but most especially with me.                                                          |

|     89      |                     I have murdered the lovely and the helpless; I have strangled the innocent as they slept, and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing.                      |
|     90      |                                                I have resigned myself to the soothing forgetfulness of death, having little other choice. It is better than sleep.                                                 |

|     95      |           I look on the hands which executed the deed; I think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived, and long for the moment when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more.            |

|     99      |                I sensed something else stirring all around me, like a wind that one feels only in the mind... Magic. Necromancy. I’d done more this night than kill my brother and drink his blood.                |

|     101     |                                            I took one of her hands, and she straightened—how like a tall flower she was—and with a bow, lightly kissed her fingertips.                                             |

|     107     |                    I was not even able to attend the burial of my parents. Their deaths had occurred during the height of a particularly close and bitter campaign, and I could not be spared.                     |
|     108     |     I wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling, but I learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain, and that was death - a state which I feared yet did not understand.     |

|     119     |             If you will comply with my conditions, I will leave them and you at peace; but if you refuse, I will glut the maw of death, until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends.             |

|     127     |                                  It was as if the sun that had favored me had been all along hidden by a cloud. Its brilliant glory now shone in full upon him... and him alone.                                   |
|     128     |                        It was over very quickly, raising a collective gasp from the crowd since it is something of a shock to see how far the blood spurts when a head is expertly severed.                        |
|     129     |                                    It writhed and twisted and pulsed without rhythm—pleasure from pain, pain from pleasure—and it murmured of things still darker than itself.                                     |
|     130     |                         Learn to kill and mind the details. It is not unlike mending greaves. The first time, you are careful. By the thirteenth time, you forget where you left the awl.                          |
|     131     |                      Like as not the peasants will use the time away from their fields to clean out their stocks of tuika and spend the following day struggling to recover from the debauch.                      |

|     135     |                                                Love is, after all, a selfish thing; and it throws a black shadow on anything between which and the light it stands.                                                |

|     146     |                    My last sight of myself was of a man utterly consumed by surprise, utterly ludicrous, utterly laughable with his popping eyes and hanging mouth. My relfection... was gone.                     |

|     148     |               My toil must be in silence, and my efforts all in secret; for in this enlightened age, when men believe not even what they see, the doubting of wise men will be my greatest strength.               |
|     149     |                                                No man knows till he experiences it, what it is like to feel his own life-blood drawn away into the woman he loves.                                                 |

|     153     |                                  No soldier ever wearies of receiving letters from home. The smallest detail was always of great interest to me and kept my memories from fading.                                  |
|     154     |                                                                  Not one of your best days. If I were you, I would start making the most of them.                                                                  |

|     156     |                      Of what materials was I made, that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of the wheel, continually renewed the torture? But I was doomed to live.                       |
|     157     |                                                    Once again... welcome to Barovia. Come freely. Die quickly; and leave something of the happiness you bring.                                                     |

|     163     |                    Previously, my interest in the Art had been that of an experimenting dilettante; now it occurred to me that some magical spell might afford the means to my heart’s desire.                     |
|     164     |                                                          Remember my friend, that knowledge is stronger than memory, and we should not trust the weaker.                                                           |
|     165     |                                      Remember that I have power; you believe yourself miserable, but I can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you.                                      |

|     167     |                                 Secret and safe in some hidden cache within me, the blackness was always ready to rush forth and resume gnawing at my soul like a starved monster.                                 |
|     168     |                                                                        See that you die with dignity; it is more than can be said for most.                                                                        |

|     170     |                          She is one of the gods’ women fashioned by their own hands to show us mortals that there is a heaven where we can enter, and that its light can be here with us.                          |
|     171     |                               She was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects.                                |
|     172     |                                                                           She was sky and earth, air and music, sunlight without shadow.                                                                           |

|     174     |                                                                          She was, without doubt, the most beautiful girl I had ever seen.                                                                          |
|     175     |                                                  She wore the homespun costume of Barovia, but she wore it like royalty, and her copper hair shone like a crown.                                                   |
|     176     |                                                                                      Sleep has no place it can call its own.                                                                                       |

|     179     |                                           Some have intended to plague me with hammer, stake, and holy symbols under the mistaken impression they were doing me a favor.                                           |

|     183     |                                              Such evil would not have come without some type of summoning on my part, which meant I had a portion of control over it.                                              |

|     191     |           The Balinoks were overrun with savage druids worshipping pagan gods. One by one, I searched out and... civilized... their sacred fanes until even they were forced to acknowledge my lordship.           |

|     194     |                              The clear skin, the great eyes—brighter than gems—and full dark lips had come together in such a way as to make all other women seem ugly by comparison.                              |

|     201     |             The laughter grew, filling the rooms, filling my head, I clapped my hands over my ears, dropping the dagger. Whatever was with me would not be vulnerable to such an insignificant weapon.             |

|     206     |                            The particular dilemma of when and if one should use force always seemed to plague the soldier-priests. Such moral puzzles held no appeal for me whatsoever.                            |
|     207     |                                                                     The peace of the indifferent dead is held most in the mind of the living.                                                                      |
|     208     |   The people had managed to gather a gaggle of brats to present bouquets of flowers to me. During the wars I’d been forced to do many terrible things in the name of duty, but one must draw the line somewhere.   |
|     209     |                                                                         The time has come to prove yourself, friend. You know what to do.                                                                          |
|     210     | The voices merged and separated around, above, through me. They took on weight with no substance and pressed upon me. The voices laughed at my pain, and in that sound they seemed to assume a single, huge shape. |
|     211     |                                                 The wolves of Mount Ghakis are ferocious, but I have yet to hear of one who could break through a handspan of oak.                                                 |
|     212     |        The writer’s conclusion that love was a force that could not be successfully reproduced by magical methods struck me as being inanely smug. I tore the page out and summarily tossed it in the fire.        |
|     213     |                                                                                 There are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely.                                                                                 |

|     215     |                                            There are horrors beyond life’s edge that we do not suspect, and once in a while your evil prying may call them into range.                                             |

|     219     |              There is love in me the likes of which you have never seen. There is rage in me the likes of which you should never escape. If I am not satisfied in the one, I will indulge the other.               |
|     220     |                                                                                          There is never nothing to lose.                                                                                           |

|     225     |                                              They fought and screamed and died. Their blades passed through me as though I were a wraith with no substance or nerve.                                               |

|     255     |                                    You purpose to kill me. How dare you sport thus with life? Do your duty towards me, and I will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind.                                     |
