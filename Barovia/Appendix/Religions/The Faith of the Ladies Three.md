In Soldav, the hidden bastion of the Mountain Folk, the people still keep to the old faith of [[the Ladies of the Fanes]]: [[The Ladies of the Fanes|the Weaver]], [[The Ladies of the Fanes|the Seeker]], and [[The Ladies of the Fanes|the Huntress]]. They do their best to honor their goddesses with offerings of food, flowers, and song, but mourn the loss of knowledge and tradition that came when the druids betrayed their faith for Strahd’s protection. They no longer remember the sacred rites that once bound their ancestors to the Ladies’ fellowship, nor do they remember the secrets of the Ladies’ blessings.

The Mountain Folk still remember, though, that [[The Ladies of the Fanes|the Weaver]]’s holy place was the Swamp Fane, near the ruined town on the shores of the Luna River; [[The Ladies of the Fanes|the Huntress]]'s, the Forest Fane, atop Yester Hill; and [[The Ladies of the Fanes|the Seeker]]’s, the Mountain Fane, in a western clearing in the valley's woodland basin.

They remember that [[The Ladies of the Fanes|the Seeker]] was a goddess of foresight, prophecy, and storms, her sigil a raven’s eye, ever-searching. They remember that [[The Ladies of the Fanes|the Weaver]] was a goddess of resilience, craftsmanship, and care, her sigil a spider’s delicate web. They remember, too, that [[The Ladies of the Fanes|the Huntress]] was a goddess of beasts, wild places, and war, her sigil a sharpened wolf’s tooth.

Together, this trinity oversaw each life that was born in the valley: [[The Ladies of the Fanes|the Seeker]], forging the threads of fate that would bind them together; [[The Ladies of the Fanes|the Weaver]], spinning those threads into a lush and vibrant tapestry; and [[The Ladies of the Fanes|the Huntress]], cutting each thread at its appointed time, and ushering its soul into death.
