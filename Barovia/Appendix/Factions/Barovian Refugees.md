Those [[Barovians]] who fled their village in the aftermath of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s siege faced a long and difficult path on the road to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]. Several lost their lives, whether to wolf attacks or malicious undead, leaving the survivors to bury them along the way—if, of course, there was anything left to bury.

When they arrived outside [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]’s walls and asked for sanctuary, however, they were met with disturbing news: the gates of the town were closed to them. News of Barovia’s siege had traveled to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]’s streets, and Baron Vallakovich had evidently become convinced that the [[Barovians]] themselves were an accursed, unsavory people—and that permitting them to enter his “perfect” town would only empower the [[Strahd von Zarovich|Devil]] to destroy it.

Most of the refugees despaired, but only a few struck out on the path back to Barovia; those that did were never seen again. The rest linger on the outskirts of [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], huddling in threadbare tents and bedrolls. Their encampment hugs close to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]’s palisade walls, praying that the silvered spears and crossbows of the town’s guards will keep the beasts of the woods at bay—and that, sooner or later, the people of [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] will change their minds and allow them entry.

So far, the wolves have kept their distance, but so have the Vallakians. With resources running low, and morale even lower, the refugees are slowly running out of time—even as the shadows of the woods creep ever-closer to their campfires.
