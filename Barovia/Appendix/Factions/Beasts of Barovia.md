While not members of any civilized society, the wolves, rats, and bats of Barovia are [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s loyal servants and spies. Each day, at sunrise and sunset, each beast with news to report—of outsiders, of turmoil, or simply of interesting trinkets or treasures—returns to [[Castle Ravenloft]] to share what it's learned and to receive new orders to disseminate through the valley. [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s vampiric brides gather and organize their intelligence: the wolves to Volenta Popofsky, the rats to Ludmilla Vilisevic, and the bats to Anastrasya Karelova.
