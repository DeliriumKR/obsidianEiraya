*An adventure for five 3rd-level characters.*

*Commences on 28 Octyavr 735*
# B1. Old Svalich Road (A)

> [!cutscene] As the players begins their travel across the road, read:
> Black pools of water stand like dark mirrors in and around the muddy roadway as you make your way forward. Giant trees loom on both sides of the road, their branches clawing at the mist.

The journey from the tower [[Arc A - Escape from Death House#A3. Outside Death House|Outside Death House]] to [[#B2. Gates of Barovia]] is two miles long and takes forty minutes.

The woods surrounding the road are saturated with the [[Mists of Ravenloft]].
# B2. Gates of Barovia (B)

> [!cutscene] When the players approach the gates, read:
> The fog spills out of the forest to swallow up the road behind you. Ahead, jutting from the impenetrable woods on both sides of the road, are high stone buttresses looming gray in the fog. Huge iron gates hang on the stonework. Dew clings with cold tenacity to the rusted bars. Two headless statues of armed guardians flank the gate, their heads now lying among the weeds at their feet. They greet you only with silence.

> ^GatesOfBaroviaImage

The gates swing open as they approach, screeching as the hinges move. The gates close behind the characters after they pass through.

The eastern gates don't open for people trying to leave [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s domain unless they are accompanied by Vistani. The fog chokes any non-Vistani that passes through the gates or skirts around them when they are closed (see [[Mists of Ravenloft]].)

The journey from the [[#B2. Gates of Barovia]] to [[#B3. Svalich Woods]] is one-quarter mile long and takes five minutes.
# B3. Svalich Woods (C)

> [!cutscene] When the players make there way through, read:
> Towering trees, whose tops are lost in heavy gray mist, block out all but a death-gray light. The tree trunks are unnaturally close to one another, and the woods have the silence of a forgotten grave, yet exude the feeling of an unvoiced scream.

> [!cutscene] Then, addressing the player with the highest Passive Perception, read:
> You catch the scent of death on the air, its source seemingly a few paces from the road.

> [!cutscene] When the characters follow the stench to its source, read:
> The foul scent leads you to a human corpse half-buried in the underbrush about fifteen feet from the road. The young man appears to be a commoner. His muddy clothes are torn by bramble and thorns. The man has obviously been dead for several days, although there is no discernible wounds on his body.
> He holds a small lidded device made of tarnished copper in one hand, splayed out in the direction of a nearby tree. You gaze drifts to it for a moment, where you notice markings have been carved into the bark.

The dead man is Dalvan Olensky. He doesn't appear to have any visible wounds, but a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals that he died of exhaustion.

While Dalvan's compass remains close to the edge of the Barovian valley, its needle trembles strangely even when held still.

> [!tip]- What happened to Dalvan?
> In the wake of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s attack on the village of Barovia, one of the survivors—a young man named Dalvan Olensky—was overcome with terror and despair.
> 
> Determined to find a way free from Barovia, Dalvan traveled to the Vistani encampment at Tser Pool, seeking out the reputed Vistani seer [[Madam Eva]]. There, [[Madam Eva]] read his future in the Tarokka cards, and drew the Horseman—a card that predicted that he would die in the Barovian valley.
> 
> Panicked, Dalvan returned to the village of Barovia under cover of night, stole a horse and compass, and set off for the eastern road out of Barovia. When the Svalich Road seemed to end, Dalvan delved into the woods, crossing through the mist and reemerging on the opposite side of the road.
> 
> A terrified, desperate, and delirious Dalvan repeated the loop thirteen times, his stolen horse expiring from exhaustion halfway through. It wasn't long before Dalvan succumbed to the effects of the Barovian fog as well—though not before inscribing his own epitaph in the form of the carving on the fourth tree.
> 
> [[Madam Eva]] regrets Dalvan's fate—but as the avatar of [[Madam Eva|the Seeker]], she is bound to read the future when asked, and knows that no efforts to escape can unravel a future that she has foreseen.

> [!info]- Dalvan's Compass
> Like all compasses in Barovia, Dalvan's compass behaves strangely as it approaches the vicinity of the edge of the Barovian valley—such as by Yester Hill in [[Arc J - The Stolen Gem]] or toward the peak of Mount Ghakis in [[Arc S - The Sword of Sunlight]]. Because there is no true "magnetic north" beyond the Mists that encircle Barovia, the needle of a compass that approaches the edge of the valley begins to tremble and eventually spin wildly the closer it gets. (This strange behaviour ends when the compass is removed from the edge of the valley.)
> ^DalvansCompassItem

The nearby tree has been carved into. A successful Wisdom (Nature) check DC10 reveals that sap has only started to seep through, meaning the carvings are no more than 6 days old.
The symbols on the tree are thirteen tally marks and an arrow that points deeper into the woods, along what seems to be a well-travelled footpath.

If the players follow the footpath in the direction of the arrow, they soon come to a second tree, which bears another thirteen tally marks and an arrow that points further along the direction of the footpath. The edge of the footpath here bears the corpse of a **horse**, which is in a similar state of decay to Dalvan's. A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check reveals the horse died of exhaustion.

If the players continue to follow the footpath in the direction of the arrows, they come to a third tree, which bears another thirteen tally marks and an arrow that points further along the direction of the footpath, which visibly vanishes into a wall of impenetrable fog.

The fog is part of the Mists that surround and entrap Barovia. If the players brought Dalvan's compass with them, the needle is now spinning wildly in circles.

If the players follow the footpath through the fog, they emerge after 2d4 minutes in an unfamiliar portion of the Svalich Woods. As noted in [[Mists of Ravenloft]], each time the players emerge from the wall of fog around Barovia, they must make a DC 5 Constitution saving throw or take 1 level of exhaustion, as the fog saps their energy and drains their life force. (The DC increases by 5 each time that the players pass through the fog again, and resets on a long rest.)

Upon emerging from the fog, the players can see a fourth tree, which bears another thirteen tally marks and an arrow that points further along the direction of the footpath. In addition, the fourth tree appears to bear a carving and has an object protruding from its trunk.

> [!cutscene] If the players inspect it, read:
> Someone has stabbed an old dagger in the trunk of this old, gnarled tree. Beside it is a rough carving of a figure atop a horse, just above two sets of rough-hewn words:
> 
> "THE HORSEMAN RIDES."
> 
> "THE SEER SPOKE TRUE."

If the players follow the footpath in the direction of the arrow, they find that it crosses the Svalich Road before returning to the location of Dalvan's corpse.

If the players then leave Dalvan's corpse and return, they find that both his and the horse's remains have vanished.

> [!warning]- Design Note: Dalvan's Fate
> Dalvan’s role has been revised from the original module to foreshadow Madam Eva’s prophetic insight and communicate the perils (and mechanics) of entering the Mists.
> 
> Dalvan and his horse will later reappear as the skeletal rider in [[Arc C - Into the Valley]]. The rider will again appear in [[Arc O - Dinner with the Devil]], guiding the players at Madam Eva’s direction to Katarina’s tree and long-lost locket, which the players can use to let Varushka’s spirit find peace in [[Arc O - Dinner with the Devil]].

If the characters linger in the woods after Dalvan's corpse disappears, they hear a lone wolf howl far off in the forest. Each round, one more wolf adds its voice to the howling, with the sound getting progressively closer to the party. If the characters are still in the woods after 5 rounds of howling, five Dire Wolves arrive and attack. If the characters are trying to leave Barovia, these dire wolves are joined by a pack of twenty wolves. The wolves and the dire wolves stop their attack if the characters return to the road and head toward [[#B5. The Village of Barovia (E)]].
# B4. Barovian Overlook (D)

The players emerge from the Svalich Woods one mile and twenty minutes after departing Dalvan's corpse.

> [!cutscene] When they do, read:
> The dark woods fall away, revealing a misted, gloomy valley dotted with thick clouds of fog.
> 
> Rolling thunderclouds cast a gray pall over the land below, no sun visible in the cold, grey light. Evergreen trees climb the sides of the mountains that enclose the valley. To the north rises a stony mount with tufts of trees; to the south, a snow-capped peak with rugged slopes towers imperiously above the land below.
> 
> The muddy road continues on ahead, passing through yellowed grasses and farmland until it reaches a small, humble settlement hunkered down in the earth. Alongside the road, a river flows as clear as a blue winter sky through the valley.
> 
> Far above the village looms a dark, twisted castle, standing alone atop a pillar of sheer stone. For an instant, a distant spear of lightning crackles, illuminating the towering keep in harsh lights and shadows—and then a thick bank of fog rolls in, concealing the village and castle from view.

The journey from here to the outskirts of the village is two miles long and takes forty minutes.
# B5. The Village of Barovia (E)

> [!info]- The Fortified Village
>The village of Barovia has been heavily fortified to defend against [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s nightly siege. Barricades composed of logs, planks, and broken furniture have been erected at every major entrance into the settlement, with additional obstructions raised in every alleyway or gap between the villagers’ homes. A trench has been dug around the village and planted with sharp stakes, and archers patrol the rooftops at all hours of day and night.

## B5a. The Barricade
---
When the players make there way towards [[The Village of Barovia]], those who have played before may be confused by the change to Barovia village. This can be used as a good signal to them that not all is as it was, and that they should prepare for further surprises.

> [!cutscene] When the players approach Barovia, read:
> As the morning deepens, the overcast skies brightening to a dull, gloomy grey, the outskirts of the village come into clearer view. A wide dirt trench surrounds the settlement, five feet across and just as deep, with hundreds of sharpened wooden stakes thrusting up like jagged teeth from the earth within. Up ahead, beside a tall heap of charred wood, the road continues over a makeshift wooden bridge, the muddy ground beyond giving way to slick, wet cobblestones.
> 
> Wooden barricades stand haphazardly along the streets. The structures around them bear scorch marks and gashes, and several buildings show partially collapsed roofs or walls, allowing the cold, creeping fog to drift silently inside.
> 
> The tall shapes of village dwellings stand above, looming out of the dense fog that clings to the earth. Figures bearing crossbows patrol the old rooftops above, while a half-dozen haunted-looking villagers make repairs to a thirty-foot-long barricade blocking the main street. A tall, broad-shouldered man with shoulder-length blond hair and a chiseled jaw leads the work, wearing an old longsword buckled to his hip and a set of splint armor over a collared coat. A raven with blue-tipped wings perches atop one of the rooftops nearby, watching the proceedings below with obvious interest.

The man is [[Ismark Kolyanovich]]. The raven is [[Muriel Vinshaw]], a disguised **wereraven** and member of the [[Keepers of the Feather]]. 

> [!handout]- Ismark Kolyanovich by Caleb Cleaveland
> ![[Ismark Kolyanovich by Caleb Cleveland.png]]
> ^IsmarkKolyanovichbyCalebCleaveland

Two **scouts** bearing light crossbows (+4 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target, _Hit:_ 6 (1d8 + 2) piercing damage) and named [[Kereza]] and [[Korga]] stand watch on the rooftops nearby, while six Barovian **commoners** make repairs to the barricade.

> [!combat]- Barovian Scout - Statistics
> ```statblock
> creature: Barovian Scout
> ```

> [!cutscene] When the players approach the barrier, read:
> A woman on the rooftops calls down to you: “Halt! Declare yourselves—be you dead or alive?" Her compatriot, a grim-looking man clad in leather armor, twitches toward the crossbow at his hip.

This is [[Kereza]], who challenges them on approach. [[Kereza]] is suspicious of the players, believing them to be vampires, zombies, or ghouls in disguise. Regardless of the players’ response, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] intervenes, gently chiding [[Kereza]] for her paranoia and reassuring the other [[Barovians]] with good humour that the players are clearly alive, “just like us."

[[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] then kindly invites the players beyond the barricade through a removable section and welcomes them. He confesses, however, that he’s afraid they’ve come at a poor time, sharing that the village has been under siege by an undead horde the past several nights.

After confirming that the barricade is nearly repaired, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] invites the players to join him at [[Arc B - Welcome to Barovia#B5c. The Blood of the Vine Tavern (E2)|the Blood of the Vine Tavern]] at the centre of town, where they can speak further and share drinks. 

“We have at least three hours before dusk falls," he says, squinting at the grey sky overhead. “Should give us enough time before the dead return."

If the players agree, [[Muriel Vinshaw]] follows them to the town square, staying aloft in the air overhead and watching with keen interest.

> [!example]- The Raven
> [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] doesn’t know that the [[Muriel Vinshaw|blue-winged raven]] is a wereraven, and doesn’t know whether anyone has given it a name. He believes the raven’s presence is a good omen, however, and can share the superstition about ravens described in [[Barovians#Beliefs and Superstitions|Barovian Belifs and Suprtstitions]].
## B5b. Town Square
---
> [!cutscene] As the players and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] pass through the village streets, read:
> Haggard villagers with haunted eyes watch as you pass, their clothes stained dark with dirt or blood and their hands never far from a bow, axe, or pitchfork. [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] greets each one by name. Several approach him, speaking quietly in hushed tones before fleeing once more into the groaning homes or gloomy alleyways around you.
> 
> [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] guides you through a second, larger barricade, manned by grim-faced villagers wielding clubs and spears. Beyond it rises an old, chipped stone statue standing at the centre of a small town square, depicting a man wearing leather armour and holding a sword. More than a dozen makeshift tents and campfires have been set up around it, hosting a dreary-looking host of young, old, and sickly-looking villagers.

Give the players a moment to react if they wish to, then continue.

> [!cutscene] When the players and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] approach the tavern, read:
> A single shaft of light thrusts illumination into the main square, its brightness looking like a solid pillar in the heavy fog. Above the gaping doorway, a sign hangs precariously askew, proclaiming this to be the Blood on the Vine tavern.
> Your gaze lingers for a moment on the sign, then your eyes narrow. Upon slight inspection of the sign, it appears that it originally read "Blood of the Vine" but the "f" has been scratched over, replaced with an "n" some time ago.

> [!Handout] Blood of the Vine Tavern Sign
> Find Art for the Blood of the Vine Tavern sign for use to set mood while inside.
> ^BloodoftheVineTavernSignArt

The tents host the village’s elderly, sick, and children, who have been gathered here as a fortification of last resort. The statue bears a weather-worn plaque at its base, which reads: 

“[[Ismark, the Great|ISMARK ANTONOVICH THE GREAT]]. Burgomaster of Barovia. Bane of Vampires. 618—662 B.C." 

> [!handout]- "Ismark the Great" by Caleb Cleveland
> [[Ismark the Great by Caleb Cleveland.png]]
> ^IsmarktheGreatImage

If the players ask about the statue, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] can share the following information:

- In life, [[Ismark, the Great|Ismark Antonovich]], also known as [[Ismark, the Great|Ismark the Great]], was a mighty warrior and the burgomaster of [[The Village of Barovia]]. In his prime, he fought scores of vampires and other undead left behind when [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] vanished from public view. He eventually died defending a group of trappers from a dire wolf attack at the age of 44, and the statue outside was erected in his honour.
- [[Ismark, the Great|Ismark Antonovich]] was [[Ismark Kolyanovich]]'s great-grandfather. [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]'s father, [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]], gave him that name in the hopes that he would one day become a great warrior.
## B5c. The Blood of the Vine Tavern (E2)
---
The tavern building is about 60 feet square. 

> [!handout]- Blood of the Vine Tavern - Background Art
> Find some art for the Blood of the Vine Tavern, for use as a background
> ^BloododtheVineTavernBackgrounImage

This once finely appointed tavern has grown shoddy over the years. A blazing fire in the hearth gives scant warmth to the few huddled souls within.

They include the barkeep [[Arik Lorensk|Arik]] who is the sole proprietor of the tavern, and a man named [[Bildrath Cantemir]] who owns [[#B5e. Bildrath's Mercantile (E1)]].

> [!info]- Where'd everybody go? Bingo?
> Alenka, Mirabel, and Sorvia, the Vistani in the original module, aren’t present in the tavern, having fled the village for Tser Pool the day before the siege began.

After entering the tavern, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] pays [[Arik Lorensk|Arik]] to fetch them drinks, which he promptly does. As the players sit down with him, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] apologizes for the state of the village and asks how they’ve come to arrive in the valley.

"You must have a thousand questions," he says sympathetically. "I'd be glad to answer as many as I can."
Then let the players take the floor.

[[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] can share the following information:

- The players have entered the land of Barovia, a realm surrounded by [[Mists of Ravenloft|deadly fog]] and ruled by [[Strahd von Zarovich]], a powerful vampire who slumbered in [[Castle Ravenloft]] until recently.
  
- Outsiders are occasionally spirited into Barovia by the [[Mists of Ravenloft|mists]]. ([[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] has no knowledge of [[Arc A - Escape from Death House|Death House]], but vaguely remembers tales of unorthodox ways by which travellers have come to the valley.) There is no escaping Barovia once an outsider has entered it.
  
- Just over three months ago, a man named [[Doru]], the son of the [[Father Donavich|village priest]], raised a rebellion against the [[Castle Ravenloft|castle]], hoping to free the valley from its prison in [[Mists of Ravenloft|the mists]]. Their revolt failed, awakening [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] from his dormancy and spurring the vampire to vow vengeance upon the village below.
  
- Several dozen [[Barovians]] fled to [[the town of Vallaki]], almost a day’s travel to the west. The remainder stayed in the village, determined to defend their homes and those who were unable to make the journey.
  
- Six nights ago, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s undead forces began attacking the town. Each night, the [[Barovians]] beat back multiple waves of the dead—and each night, the horde comes ever-closer to breaching the village’s defences.
  
- Many [[Barovians]] fear that the village is doomed. The undead have infested the woods to the north, west, and south, blocking the [[#B1. Old Svalich Road (A)]] just past the Ivlis River. With [[Mists of Ravenloft|the Mists]] blocking passage to the east, the village has been effectively cut off from the world, left to survive on its own—or perish.

[[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] can also share the village’s recent history, as well as most of the information he has regarding [[Barovians#Barovian Lore|Barovian Lore]]. 

[[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] doesn't mention a "mad wizard" (which has been removed) and he doesn't suggest that the [[Vistani]] serve [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] (a notion that has also been removed.)
[[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]’s father, [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich]], is still alive—albeit wounded—in the [[#B5d. Burgomaster's Mansion (E4)]], and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]’s sister, [[Ireena Kolyana]], hasn’t yet been bitten by [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]].
### Bildrath's Fury

> [!cutscene] Shortly after [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] begins answering the player's questions, read:
> Something slams against a nearby table—and the sound draws your attention to a man sitting not far away, his clenched fist twitching against his table's wooden surface. He is squat, with greasy receding salt-and-pepper hair and a patched, well-worn coat. A scowl mars his face as he turns his dark eyes toward your group.
> "It's a fool's errand to put your faith in Ismark the _Lesser_," he rasps, eyes lingering upon each of you.
> "Best to seek better company, lest you wind up in the ground with the last fools that trusted him."

The man is [[Bildrath Cantemir]], the owner of [[#B5e. Bildrath's Mercantile (E1)]]. If any of the players appear interested in speaking with him further, he invites them to sit at his table instead to "hear the real story of this bloody land."
"The wine's shit," he grunts, shoving a pitcher of wine across the table, "but so's everything else."

> [!handout]- Bildrath Cantemir - Character Art
> Find art for Bildrath Cantemir
> ^BildrathCantemirImage

If asked about [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]]'s statement about "the last fools that trusted him," [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] winces.
"He's right to hate me," he says quietly. "I asked the other villagers to stay and defend our homes. I was arrogant and foolish—I didn't appreciate just how powerful the Devil and his creatures were." He closes his eyes. "Now dozens of my friends and neighbors are gone—and I'm still here."

Should one or more of the players join him, [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] can share the following information:

- Just over three months ago, a pack of would-be "revolutionaries" marched off to [[Castle Ravenloft]] to "slay the vampire." [[Doru]], the son of [[Father Donavich]], the village priest, "filled their heads with fairy tales" of banishing the [[Mists of Ravenloft|Mists]] and bringing the Sun back to Barovia.
- None of the revolutionaries ever came back. A few days later, a dusk-skinned elf came to the village and announced that the village had ninety days to make peace with the gods before the lord of [[Castle Ravenloft]]—now awoken after a hundred years of slumber—exacted penance for their disobedience.
- Some villagers left. Many others wanted to leave. However, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] delivered a resounding speech in the village square before the statue of [[Ismark, the Great]], promising the villagers that those who remained would stand and defend their homes. "The audacity of the bastard," [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] sneers. "Standing in front of his great-grandfather's statue like he was worth a _tenth_ of him."
- [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] wanted to leave—but his sister, [[Marta]], and her husband, [[Dragomir]], chose to stay with their son, [[Parriwimple]], inspired by [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]'s words. Unwilling to leave his family, [[Bildrath Cantemir|BIldrath]] stayed as well. "They figured they'd fight to defend what's theirs," he chokes out, blinking back tears. "Bloody _idiots_ should've run, and never looked back."
- Ninety days after the elf delivered his proclamation, the undead came, swarming in hordes dozens strong from the [[#B3. Svalich Woods (C)]]. The villagers fought back, defending the streets with barricades, swords, and arrows. "But the dead kept coming," [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] croaks. "And [[Marta]]—" He falls silent. ([[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] lost [[Marta]] and [[Dragomir]] in the attacks, and blames [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] for his failure to protect them, which left [[Parriwimple]]—[[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]]'s nephew—an orphan.)

When he's regained his composure, [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] warns the players that the village is doomed, and likely all of Barovia with it. "There's no sun to bring back," he spits. "No escape from the [[Mists of Ravenloft|mists]]. This is Hell, now and for all eternity. The sooner you lot accept that, the better off you'll be."
### Mary's News

> [!cutscene] As the players' conversation with [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and Bildrath wind to a close, read:
> The door to the tavern swings open once more, and a woman steps through, clad in a tattered and threadbare cloak. Her hair, tied into two loops that fall around her neck, is unkempt and tangled, and her wide eyes dart across the room with fearful energy.
> 
> Her gaze falls upon [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], and she steps shakily forward. As her features come into the light, you see that her face is pale, her eyes blotchy, with dried tears staining the flesh across her cheeks. Her voice is a ragged, haunting whisper as she says, "Master Kolyanovich—I apologize for interrupting you and your guests. But I haven't seen Gertruda since last night, and Nori isn't in the stable. I think Gertruda's gone to Vallaki—alone."

The tavern immediately falls silent, and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]'s eyes crease with worry. He gives [[Mad Mary|Mary]] his condolences, and promises that he will organize a search party to look for her.
"If she didn’t make it to Vallaki, we'll find her—and bring her home safely."

> [!example]- The search party
> If the players offer to assist the search party in locating [[Gertruda]], [[Ismark]] thanks them for their generosity, but assures them that the hunters and trappers he plans to organize know the local roads and woods far better than they, and should be able to skirt alongside the edges of the undead horde without risking much trouble.
> "The more who accompany them, however," he says apologetically, "the more likely the horde notices their movements and attacks."
> 
> "If you'd like to help, however," he adds, "we can use all hands to organize tonight's defense here." [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] then makes the request given in [[#Ismark's Request]].

At this, [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] snarls and spits,
"More empty promises, Kolyanovich?" He turns to the players, glowering. "Have you lot ever seen something so cruel?"

Give the players time to react. After the players have had a chance to speak, [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] insists, "No one can survive alone on those roads. The girl's gone, Mary. I'm sorry." [[Mad Mary|Mary]] then bursts into tears.

Unless the players intervene, the following sequence then unfolds:

- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] stands up, pushing his seat away from the table. "That's enough, Master Cantemir," he growls.
- "You going to put me in my place, Master Kolyanovich?" [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] sneers. "Stop lying to the woman. The girl's as good as dead. We'll all be joining her soon enough."
- "There's always a chance," [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] says heatedly. He swallows, and glances back at Mary, then at the players. "You might have given up on our people, Bildrath, but I haven't."
- [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] eyes [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], his hands curling into fists. After a long, lingering moment, he spits on the floor and exits the tavern without addressing [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] or the players. The taproom remains deathly quiet, the silence broken only by [[Mad Mary|Mary]]'s choking sobs.

If the players ask, [[Mad Mary|Mary]] can share the following information:

- [[Gertruda]] is her twenty-one-year-old daughter. Ever since [[Doru]], her betrothed, marched on [[Castle Ravenloft]] and failed to return, [[Gertruda]] has become fixated on [[the Town of Vallaki]], believing that if she could only journey to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] and speak with the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Burgomaster]], she could convince him to bring aid.
- [[Mad Mary|Mary]] has repeatedly forbidden [[Gertruda]] from traveling away from the village. With the advent of the siege, however, [[Gertruda]] has become stubbornly convinced that help from [[The Town of Vallaki|Villaki]] is the only way to end the village's suffering.
- Last night, [[Mad Mary|Mary]] and [[Gertruda]] had a tumultuous argument that ended with both on poor terms. This morning, [[Mad Mary|Mary]] woke to find their old horse, Nori, missing from her stall—and [[Gertruda]] nowhere to be found. ([[Mad Mary|Mary]] believes [[Gertruda]] took Nori in an effort to outrun the zombie horde.)

A few moments after [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] has left, if the players haven't already done so, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] turns to comfort [[Mad Mary|Mary]]. "I promise you," he says, his voice breaking, "That I will do _everything_ I can to see that Gertruda is brought home safely."

Once calmed, [[Mad Mary|Mary]] wipes her eyes, thanks [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] (and the players, if they comforted her), and departs the tavern.

> [!tip]- Where's Gertruda?
> [[Gertruda]], despairing at the state of the village and determined to show the same courage as [[Doru]], left [[The Village of Barovia|Barovia]] for [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] the morning of the players' arrival, seeking to get aid from the [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich|Burgomaster]]. [[Gertruda]], however, never made it to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]. As she made her way through the [[#B3. Svalich Woods (C)]], [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s black carriage came upon her—and the [[Strahd von Zarovich|Devil]] himself stepped out. Terrified, but unwilling to show fear, [[Gertruda]] politely demanded [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] allow supplies to be delivered to [[The Village of Barovia|Barovia]] so that the villagers could rebuild.  
>

>

### Ismark's Request

After [[Mad Mary|Mary]] departs, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] asks them to aid in defending the village’s eastern barricade that night. 
“Like it or not, we’re all in this together," he says somberly. “The more hands, the better. I don’t know if I can promise coin, but I can promise it’ll help all of us survive the night—yourselves included."
In exchange for the players’ aid, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] is glad to offer them room and board at his family’s home. (The Blood of the Vine Tavern doesn't have rooms for rent.)

If the players agree to aid in the town’s defense, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] is deeply grateful. He asks them to first retrieve a crate of “fire bottles" from his sister, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], who is overseeing the defence of the village’s southern perimeter from their home, [[#B5d. The Burgomaster's Mansion (E4)]]. ([[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], who has to return to [[#B5g. The Western Barricade]]s to prepare for the return of the dead, can’t take the time to do so himself.) If asked, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] can explain that a “fire bottle" is a bottle of distilled wine topped with a rag wick, meant to be lit and hurled at approaching undead.

Once the players have retrieved the crate of fire bottles and had an opportunity to rest at the manor, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] tells them, they should take the fire bottles to [[#B5e. The Eastern Barricade]]—the place where they first entered the village—where they’ll be stationed throughout the night.
## B5d. The Burgomaster's Mansion (E4)
---
Characters who survey the grounds here can, with a successful DC 11 Wisdom (Perception) check, discern trampled weeds all around the mansion as well as scores of humanoid footprints. The footprints were made by [[#The Angry Mob]], see below.
### The Angry Mob

When the players arrive, they find a mob of ten Barovian **commoners** has formed outside of the mansion.

 > [!cutscene] When the players approach, read:
> A weary-looking mansion squats behind a rusting iron fence. The iron gates are twisted and torn. The right gate lies cast aside, while the left swings lazily in the wind. The stuttering squeal and clang of the gate repeats with mindless precision. Weeds choke the grounds and press with menace upon the house itself. Yet, against the walls, the growth has been tramped down to create a path all about the domain. Heavy claw markings have stripped the once-beautiful finish of the walls while great black marks tell of the fires that have assailed the mansion. Not a pane nor a shard of glass stands in any window. Yet all the window frames are barred with planks, each one marked with stains of evil omen.
> 
> A small mob of villagers have gathered outside of the manor, brandishing pitchforks, brooms, and axes. A plain, tired-looking woman stands at their front, her wavy brown hair tied back with a wrinkled white bandana.
> 
> "Give her up, Kolyan!" she calls out. “Your defences have held the Devil at bay, but they haven’t ended his scourge. It’s time to take matters into our own hands."
> 
> An older man dressed in fine clothes, his thinning gray hair receding across his scalp, leans heavily on a cane in the door. Heavy, bloodstained bandages wrap around his stomach, forehead, and left knee. Beside him stands a young woman with long, red hair and a steel breastplate over a long-sleeved gray tunic, her face ashen and tense. A rapier hangs in a sheath at her side, her right hand hovering over its glinting hilt.
> 
> “Go home, Alenka," the man booms. “The rest of you as well. For as long as I am burgomaster, I will not permit this madness."

The brown-haired woman is [[Alenka Konstantinova]], a middle-aged Barovian **commoner**. The older man is [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich]], a **veteran** with four levels of exhaustion. The red-haired young woman is [[Ireena Kolyana]].

> [!info]- Alenka's Grief
> [[Alenka]] is the sister of [[Anton Konstantinovich]], a Barovian man married to [[Dezdrelda Konstaninova]]. Two nights ago, [[Anton Konstantinovich|Anton]] and [[Dezdrelda Konstaninova|Dezdrelda]] mysteriously vanished in the middle of the night during the siege; their bodies were never found. Their loss has driven [[Alenka]] to grief and paranoia, and given her a desperate need to seek an end to the siege by any means possible.
> 
> Unbeknownst to [[Alenka]], [[Anton Konstantinovich|Anton]] and [[Dezdrelda Konstaninova|Dezdrelda]] are prisoners of [[Volenta Popofsky]], one of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s vampiric brides, in [[Castle Ravenloft]]. The players will later encounter Anton as a masked servant in [[Arc O - Dinner with the Devil]].

Driven to desperation by [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s attacks on the village, [[Alenka Konstantinova|Alenka]] and the mob believe that a sacrifice or offering is needed to appease the vampire and soothe his rage. The following conversation unfolds if the players don’t intervene:

- [[Alenka Konstantinova|Alenka]] stonily informs [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] that a sacrifice to the vampire isn’t madness, but “common sense." “Legends say the Devil Strahd enjoys preying upon red-haired women," she tells him. “If her blood might win his favor, how can we do otherwise?"
- [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] replies that [[Alenka Konstantinova|Alenka]] is a “fool" if she believes surrendering [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]—or anyone else—will appease the [[Strahd von Zarovich|Devil]] of [[Castle Ravenloft]]. “You are grasping for answers in a world that has none to offer," he thunders. “And we are Barovians. We do not turn on our own."
- [[Alenka Konstantinova|Alenka]] retorts that [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] isn’t a true [[Barovians|Barovian]]—after all, [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] found her wandering the woods near the Pillarstone of Ravenloft as a child. ([[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] are already aware of this, and show no surprise at this statement.) “She’s not one of us," [[Alenka Konstantinova|Alenka]] says sharply, “and if you’re going to choose her over us, neither are you."
- Two of [[Alenka Konstantinova|Alenka]]’s compatriots step closer to the mansion, brandishing their weapons. [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] gasps, “How dare you," steps forward, and nearly crumples from his wounds. [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] catches him before he falls and commands the mob not to “lay a finger on her father."

If the players are still present and haven’t yet intervened, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] pleads for their help as [[Alenka Konstantinova|Alenka]]’s mob advances.

If the players intervene, [[Alenka Konstantinova|Alenka]], [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]], and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] receive them with unfamiliarity and surprise, though [[Alenka Konstantinova|Alenka]] is suspicious that they may be spies for “the Devil Strahd." (If [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]’s name is mentioned, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] are reassured, though [[Alenka Konstantinova|Alenka]] spits on the ground and quietly cursed “Ismark the Lesser" under her breath.)

The players can disperse the mob by making a reasonable argument and succeeding on a DC 10 Charisma (Persuasion) check, made with advantage if the players inquire into [[Alenka Konstantinova|Alenka]]’s missing family members and show her sympathy. The players can also disperse the mob by brandishing their weapons or magic and succeeding on a DC 10 Charisma (Intimidation) check, made with advantage if they mention their recent battles in [[Arc A - Escape from Death House|Death House]].

If the players appear ready to attack the mob unprovoked, [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] pleads for them to avoid violence. “They’re confused," he says hoarsely, “but they’re Barovians, all the same."

If the players fail to disperse the mob but refuse to allow [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to be taken, [[Alenka Konstantinova|Alenka]] commands them to stand down. If they refuse, she directs the mob to knock them unconscious before taking [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]].

If combat breaks out, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] joins the players in defending the mansion while [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] pleads for the combatants to avoid killing anyone. If two of the **Barovian Commoners** are knocked unconscious, or if one is killed, the remainder flee.

If the players successfully disperse the mob, [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] invite them into the manor with gratitude.

> The interior of the mansion is well furnished, yet the fixtures show signs of great wear. Noticeable oddities are the boarded-up windows and the presence of holy symbols in every room.

If the players assisted in dispersing the mob, [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] welcome them warmly, especially if the players mention [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]’s name. Whether or not the players mention that [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] granted them room and board at the manor, [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] invites them to stay for lunch in gratitude for their aid in dealing with [[Alenka Konstantinova|Alenka]].
#### Lunch with the Burgomaster

Lunch, which is already stewing in a pot over the kitchen hearth, is a stew of turnips and rabbit meat.
[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] apologizes for the sparse meal, but the players can clearly see that the family’s pantry is nearly bare.

During the meal, [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] ask the players about their interests and lives outside of Barovia. [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] especially is fascinated by tales of the world beyond the mists.

If the players are looking to purchase additional supplies, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] offers them directions to [[#B5e. Bildrath's Mercantile (E1)]], but warns them not to mention [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]'s name. If the players ask her why [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] is called "the Lesser," [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] wince, and can share the following information:

- When [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s dusk elf servant—a cruel-looking man named [[Rahadin]]—delivered his warning three months ago, many [[Barovians]] were prepared to flee the village for [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]].
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], however, delivered a thundering and inspiring speech, invoking the memory of [[Lugdana]] and [[Ismark, the Great]] to encourage them to stay and fight for their homes. Most did so.
- When [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s siege began, many who lost homes or loved ones blamed [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], who they felt had led them astray with his foolish fantasies of heroism and valour. They now call him "[[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark, the Lesser]]" in mockery of his ancestry.
- No one feels more guilty or ashamed than [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] himself, who has taken the weight of every death incurred in the siege on his own shoulders.

If the players ask about [[Doru]]'s rebellion, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] can share the following information:

- [[Doru]] was a friend of theirs, and the son of the village priest [[Father Donavich]]. He was a bright and cheery young man, with a sunny disposition and a zeal for everything he did.
- Just over three months ago, without warning, [[Doru]] announced a crusade against [[Castle Ravenloft]], which he proclaimed would free Barovia from the [[Mists of Ravenloft|mists]] and return sunlight to the valley. Over two dozen young [[Barovians]] accompanied him, as well as a scholar from distant lands named [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Alanik Ray]], who had been staying as a guest at [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s home for the previous several weeks while studying [[Barovians#Barovian Lore|Barovian history]] and ecology.
- [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] doesn't recall much about [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Alanik]], other than that he was a curious, somewhat intense man who kept to himself, took long walks into the [[#B3. Svalich Woods (C)]], and owned a pet monkey. She does remember, however, that he had a furious argument with [[Doru]] at one point, which confused her when he accompanied [[Doru]] to [[Castle Ravenloft]] shortly thereafter.
#### Kolyan's Dilemma

During lunch, [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] invites the players to help him deliberate on a dilemma he’s been trying to solve, noting that he would find it useful to have “an outside perspective" on the matter.

> [!cutscene] If the players agree, read:
> The burgomaster nods toward a sheet of parchment lying across a writing desk. On its surface, you can make out a crude drawing of the area around the village, with thin lines depicting the Old Svalich Road and the Ivlis River to the southwest, and darker shapes depicting the Svalich Wood to the north, west, and south.
> 
> "Each night," he rumbles, “dozens of undead lay siege to our defenses, killing some and wounding many more. Instead of attacking all at once, however, they arrive in groups, with each wave striking our defenses separately, and almost randomly throughout the night. What do you make of that?"

Give the players a moment to react and respond.

> [!cutscene] After the players have discussed and answered Kolyan's question, read:
> Kolyan nods. “Interesting. One more thing: Although dozens of the dead attack the village each night, our scouts have reported that hundreds more lurk in the woods around us—perhaps as many as a thousand. If they attacked all at once, we would surely be overrun—and yet, seemingly by the grace of the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]], they have not. Why?"

If the players provide a suitably impressive or insightful answer, [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] asks if they intend to travel to the other settlements beyond [[The Village of Barovia|Barovia]] if they survive the night—namely, [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] and [[The Village of Krezk|Krezk]] to the west. If the players express an interest in doing so, [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] fetches a quill and ink from his writing desk and offers to draft them a signed letter of introduction.

> [!item]- Kolyan's Letter of Introduction
> A freshly written letter, sealed with the wax sigil of the burgomaster of Barovia: a longsword before a rising sun.
> 
> It reads:
> 
> *To whom it may concern,*
> 
> *I humbly ask that you provide the bearer of this letter with what aid you can. Trust in their purpose, assist in their endeavors, and offer shelter and counsel if you are able. Please extend to them every courtesy you would afford a friend of mine.*
> 
> *With utmost respect,*
> 
> *Kolyan Indirovich*  
> *Burgomaster of Barovia*
> 
> Players who present Kolyan’s letter of introduction to [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich]], Lady Fiona Wachter of Vallaki, [[Burgomaster Dmitri Krezkov]] of Krezk within the first ten minutes of meeting them, or their servants or family members, have advantage on any Charisma (Persuasion) check made within that ten minutes, provided it is possible for the check to succeed.
> ^KolyansLetterofIntroduction

[[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] concedes that he cannot promise the letter will be obeyed, noting it has been “years" since he travelled to any of the other settlements in the valley. He vows, however, that it should at least “open the ears" of those they may wish to approach, such as [[Baron Vargas Vallakovich]] and [[Lady Fiona Wachter]] of [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], or [[Burgomaster Dmitri Krezkov]] of [[The Village of Krezk|Krezk]].
#### Rooms at the Mansion

If the players mention [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]'s offer to provide them with rooms, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] shows them to the mansion’s two guest bedrooms and provides them with basic supplies.
"I can't say how much sleep you'll be able to get, or when," she says apologetically, her own eyes bearing dark circles beneath them. "But if nothing else, they should provide a quiet place to rest."

If the players ask about her parents, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] freely shares the following information while asking after the players' own families:

- [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s mother was [[Korina Targolova]]. [[Korina Targolova|Korina]] died of a sickness fourteen years ago, but [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] has done his best since then to continue raising both children alone. (The scarf [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] wears is her last memory of her mother.)
- [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]], their father, was the one who found [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] when she was a young girl, by the edge of the [[#B3. Svalich Woods (C)]] near the Pillarstone of Ravenloft. [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] doesn't remember anything of her past before then, but is grateful to her parents for taking her in and loving her dearly.

As the players explore their rooms, one of them finds a torn excerpt of _Van Richten's Guide to Vampires_ by [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten]] sitting on a night table by the bed. 

> [!Handout]- Excerpt from Van Richten's Guide to Vampires
> This excerpt of the preface, which [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]] tore from [[Doru]]'s book in the midst of a furious argument, reads as follows:
> 
> In some shadowed corners of the world, the vampire reigns as a fearsome predator. Beyond mere bloodlust, these creatures are cursed with a range of abilities and weaknesses that make them as enigmatic as they are terrifying.
> 
> Their bodies are resilient to mundane weapons, shrugging off blows that would fell most mortals and regenerating even grievous wounds in a matter of moments. They move with unnatural grace, their senses sharply attuned to the whispers of the night. But it is in their supernatural abilities that their true horror lies. They can bend the will of others to their own, ensnaring friend and foe with but a gaze and a whisper. They can shift form with the ease of thought, becoming bats, wolves, or even a sinister mist that creeps beneath doorways and through cracks. And those their fangs kill become vampire spawn—ravenous creatures with a vampire's hunger for blood.
> 
> These creatures are not wholly invincible, however, possessing a tapestry of strengths woven with fatal weaknesses. Sunlight and running water can end their cursed existence, and wooden stakes through the heart will paralyze them as they sleep. They recoil from the sight of certain holy symbols, and cannot enter a residence without an invitation. They bear neither shadow nor reflection, and must return to their coffins, crypts, or graves to rest by day.
> 
> It is said that the bloodlust of these creatures is an unquenchable fire that burns within their undead hearts. The young and newly turned are slaves to this craving, often losing themselves in a frenzy at the mere scent of blood. But those who have walked the night for centuries, as well as those with indomitable focus and will, may learn to temper this fire. Those who do so possess the rare ability to conceal their monstrous nature, retracting and exposing their fangs at will—a sign that the monster within is held at bay, if only while the vampire allows.
> 
> To create a new vampire, a vampire must fully drain the blood of its victim without killing it—a torturous and careful process that can often take multiple nights. For some vampires, this process is a practical means of creating fresh and powerful thralls; for others, it presents a sadistic opportunity to slowly break their victim's will. Some vampires in the latter camp may even appear as an intermittent predator in the night, haunting their target over days or weeks before finally ending their suffering.
> ^ExcerptFromVanRichtensGuidetoVampiresHandout

[[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] don't recognize the excerpt, but [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] recalls that [[Doru]] owned a copy of _Van Richten's Guide to Vampires_, which he loved. Neither is sure how this excerpt came to be in their guest room.

When the players are ready to depart, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] retrieves a wooden crate containing twelve _fire bottles_ (see below) from a closet, with each bottle packed securely between wads of straw.

> [!item]- Fire Bottle
> This bottle of Purple Grapemash No. 3, which bears the stamp of the Wizard of Wines winery, has been distilled, increasing its alcohol content, and had its cork removed and replaced with a rag wick.
> 
> As an action, a creature can use a lit torch or other fire source to light the wick, then throw the bottle up to 20 feet, shattering on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the bottle as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns.
> 
> A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.
> ^FireBottles

> [!example]- Visiting the Church
> Players who insist upon visiting [[#B5i. The Barovian Church (E5)]] find it largely as described in [[#B5i. The Barovian Church (E5)]] below. However, [[Parriwimple]] is not at the church at this time, and [[Father Donavich]] does not mention [[Doru]]'s fate without [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] or [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] present.

### B5e. Bildrath's Mercantile (E1)
---
Should the players choose to visit it before proceeding to [[#B5f. The Eastern Barricade]], this area is as described below. 

> [!cutscene] When the players approach, read:
> The sparse light from this building spills out from behind drawn heavy curtains. A sign over the door, creaking on its hinges, reads "Bildrath's Mercantile."

[[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] sells items from the [Adventuring Gear](https://2014.5e.tools/book.html#PHB,5,adventuring%20gear,0) table in the [Player's Handbook](https://2014.5e.tools/book.html#PHB), but only items with a price lower than 25 gp in the table, and he sells them for two times the price, citing the recent economic upheaval.

If any players were kind to him in the tavern, he instead sells those players items at the normal price listed in the _Player's Handbook_—a special deal, for them only.
If any players defended [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] in the tavern, [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] glowers at them and instead sells those players items at five times the price listed in the _Player’s Handbook_, spitefully claiming them to be a “special deal" for friends of the town’s “great hero."

[[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] primarily serves his own interests and offers no sanctuary. He never bargains after he's set a price, saying to those who complain "If you want it badly enough, you'll pay for it."
He has no competition in the village.

During the players’ conversation with [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]], [[Parriwimple]] enters the room carrying a box of wares that [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] asked him to fetch. He is excitedly curious about the players’ presence, but [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] orders him to return to his bedroom in order to avoid “disturbing the customers."

If the characters give [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] a hard time, he calls [[Parriwimple]]. 
[[Parriwimple]]'s real name is [[Parriwimple|Parpol Cantemir]], but no one in the village calls him that. His muscles rippling beneath his leather tunic should give ample notice of his strength.

If [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] orders [[Parriwimple]] to remove the players from the store, [[Parriwimple]] attempts to grapple them and pull them out the door, preferring to avoid violence if at all possible.
### B5f. The Eastern Barricade
---
#### Preparing the Barricade

Shortly after returning to the barricade at the eastern entrance to the village, the players are met by [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] and [[Parriwimple]].
[[Parriwimple]] has the statistics of a **berserker** with a spear (+5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage.) instead of a greataxe.
[[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] also carries a light crossbow (+2 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 4 (1d8 + 0) piercing damage).

> [!handout]- Parriwimple - Character Art
> Character art for Parriwimple
> ^ParriwimpleCharacterImage

> [!cutscene] When the players first encounter Parriwimple, read:
> A hulking figure stands at Bildrath’s side—a young man, tall and brawny. His shaggy brown hair falls messily across his face, and his crooked teeth glint in the grey light. Though muscles ripple beneath his tunic, there's a lightness and immaturity to his posture that belies his strength and size. He fidgets with the hem of his tunic as your eyes fall upon him.

[[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] greets the players warmly or coldly, depending on their interaction at the [[#B5c. The Blood of the Vine Tavern (E2)]] and (if they visited him there) [[#B5e. Bildrath's Mercantile (E1)]]. Regardless of [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]]’s disposition, [[Parriwimple]] is glad to meet new friends.

[[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] is pleased to see the players’ delivery of _fire bottles_. He can inform the players that they have been assigned to defend the eastern barricade from any smaller bands of undead that might drift around the edges of the village rather than attacking from the north, south, or west.

If any of the players treated him kindly at the [[#B5c. The Blood of the Vine Tavern (E2)]] or [[#B5e. Bildrath's Mercantile (E1)]], [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] instructs [[Parriwimple]] to present them with a crate containing two bags of ball bearings, two bags of caltrops, ten iron spikes, and three flasks of oil from his shop, to be used in preparing the barricade for the siege. [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] also directs the players to a pair of ten-foot ladders nailed to one of the houses nearby, which can allow any ranged combatants to ascend to the house’s roof. Finally, [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] instructs [[Parriwimple]] to obey those players’ instructions as though they were his own.

> As an action, you can spread a single bag of caltrops to cover a 5-foot-square area. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving and take 1 piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the saving throw.

> Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.

> [!info]- The Barricade
> The barricade the players have been assigned to defend is a thirty-foot-long, six-foot-tall assembly of tree logs, piled furniture, and nailed wooden planks. Each five-foot-long section of the barricade has AC 15, 10 hit points, and immunity to piercing, psychic, and poison damage.
> 
> Wooden platforms scattered across the western side of the barricade allow defenders to peer over the edge and attack approaching enemies. While behind the barricade, defenders have full cover, or three-quarters cover while standing on a platform.
#### The Siege

Dusk falls soon after the players complete their preparations. 

> [!cutscene] As it does, read:
> As the last shades of light fade from the sky, an eerie silence descends upon the village. A chill wind whispers through the streets, carrying with it the faint scent of decay as the leaves of the Svalich Woods rustle in the distance.
> 
> A blood-curdling howl pierces the night, followed by a second—and then a third. The cacophony of inhuman shrieks and moans grows louder, echoing across the basin from all directions as the distant forest seems to come alive.

If he is present, [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]]’s face grows grim, and he grips his crossbow tightly.
“It begins," he mutters, as the din fades once more into the cold night. [[Parriwimple]] nods in determination, clutching his spear closer to his chest.

> [!info]- A Moonless Night
> At night, torches mounted at ten-foot intervals along the barricade illuminate the surrounding area out to a distance of forty feet. On the night of the siege, thick fog rolls in with the undead up to the area of illumination, preventing defenders with darkvision from seeing any approaching creatures early.

> [!example]- Holding the Line
> If the zombies successfully break through the barricade, [[Parriwimple]] attempts to hold the choke point with his spear, though he’s grateful for any aid the players might provide.

> [!info]- Undead Fortitude
> Revise each **zombie** and **zombie plague spreader’s** **_undead fortitude_** feature to read as follows:
> 
>- **_Undead Fortitude (1/day)._** If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead. The zombie can’t use this ability if the damage is radiant or from a critical hit, if the damage taken is 15 or more, or if it had only 1 hit point remaining.

> [!combat]- Fight against the Siege
> Due to the wave mechanic, this combat encounter is a series of two consecutive **mild** combat encounters and a third **bloody** combat encounter against a party of five 3rd-level players, a CR 0 ally ([[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]]), and a CR 5 ally ([[Parriwimple]]), the first of which will consume approximately 15% of their total maximum hit points, the second of which will consume approximately 17% of their total maximum hit points, and the third of which will consume approximately 34% of their maximum hit points (for a total of 66% of their maximum hit points). For parties of smaller or larger sizes, modify the encounter as follows:
>
>- **Three Players**. Reduce the number of barovian zombies in the first wave to 5. Remove the barovian zombies in the second wave. Replace the wight in the third wave with a ghoul.
>- **Four Players**. Reduce the number of barovian zombies in the first wave to five. Reduce the number of barovian zombies in the second wave to one. Replace the wight in the third wave with three barovian zombies.

##### The First Wave
Not long after darkness falls, six **zombies** emerge from the darkness and approach the barricade.

> [!cutscene] When they do, read:
> Six figures shamble toward the barricade, the whites of their eyes glinting in the torchlight. Their low, guttural moans echo through the night, their rotting arms outstretched toward you.

> [!combat]- Fight against the Siege's First Wave
> This wave consists of six **Barovian Zombies**, making this a **mild** combat encounter against a party of five 3rd-level players, a CR 0 ally ([[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]]), and a CR 5 ally ([[Parriwimple]]). This will consume approximately 15% of their total maximum hit points.

##### The Second Wave
At the beginning of the third round of combat after the first wave arrives, two additional **zombies** emerge from the darkness, joined by two **ghouls**.

> [!cutscene] When it does, read:
> Two more zombies shamble from the gloom, flanked by a pair of gaunt, feral, humanoid creatures with razor-sharp claws and hungry, glowing eyes. These ghouls move with a predatory grace, their lipless mouths revealing rows of pointed teeth as they release shrieking howls that echo through the night.

##### The Third Wave
At the beginning of the seventh round of combat after the first wave arrives, a **wight** and a **barovian zombie plague spreader** (_Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft_, p. 255) approach the barricade.

> [!cutscene] When they do, read:
> A lone undead shambles slowly from the darkness, its white eyes staring dully past the flickering torchlight. Its flesh, though rotting, is a smooth, sickly white, its skin run through with raised, crimson veins. A faint cloud of reddish mist spills continually from its mouth and down onto the bloodstained earth before dissipating into the air.

> [!info]- The Plague Spreader
> Increase the **plague spreader's** hit points to 130, decrease the necrotic damage dealt by its **_slam_** to 5 (1d8), and decrease the damage dealt by its **_virulent miasma_** to 7 (2d6) poison damage per creature.
> 
> In addition, revise its **_virulent miasma_** action such that a Humanoid reduced to 0 hit points doesn’t automatically die, and instead only rises as a zombie if it dies before stabilizing or regaining hit points. The DC for stabilizing a creature reduced to 0 hit points in this way increases to 20.

> [!combat]- Fight against the Siege's Third wave
> This wave consists of one **Barovian Zombie Plague Spreader** and one **Wight**, who join the siege at the beginning of the seventh round of combat after the first wave arrives, making this a **Bloody** encounter against a party of five 3rd-level players, a CR 0 ally ([[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]]), and a CR 5 ally ([[Parriwimple]]).

> 
> The plague spreader first approaches the players as closely as possible, then releases its **_virulent miasma_**, attempting to hit as many creatures as possible. (If possible, aim to ensure that the miasma hits [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]], to make sure the players understand the nature of its attack. Neither [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] nor [[Parriwimple]] have seen or heard of a zombie plague spreader before, and both are ignorant of the virus it carries.) After the plague spreader uses its miasma, the red mist stops spilling from its mouth.
> 
> Meanwhile, the wight attacks from the darkness beyond the torches’ light, making **_longbow_** attacks from 60 feet away. If the players engage the plague spreader in melee combat or reduce it to 90 hit points or fewer, the wight draws its **_longsword_** and engages the players directly.

### B5g. The Western Barricade
---
#### The Raven's Guidance

Shortly after the players dispatch the final wave, the **wereraven** [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]] appears to them in **raven** form.

> [!cutscene] When she does, read:
> A small, dark silhouette plunges from the skies above, resolving into the form of a familiar raven, its blue-tipped wings flashing in the torchlight. Its eyes are wide and panicked, and an urgent, desperate shriek sounds repeatedly from its wide-open beak.

Although she can’t speak in raven form, [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]] attempts to nonverbally alert the players that the western barricade has fallen, pulling their hair and clothes toward the town square.

> [!cutscene] If the players don't immediately follow, read:
> You hear terrified shouts in the distance, and the sound of crunching wood.
#### Ismark's Last Stand

If the players follow her, [[Muriel Vinshaw|Muriel]] guides them west toward the town square, then leads them through a series of alleyways behind and around the [[#B5c. The Blood of the Vine Tavern (E2)]], finally emerging on the north side of the street just west of the town square. 

> [!cutscene] When the players arrive, read:
> Dozens of bodies litter the street, bloody and unmoving. The air is thick with the pungent scent of rot and death, and the howling wind sings with the sound of terrified screams.
> 
> The barricade protecting the town square has been shattered, its splintered remains surrounded by a mound of corpses nearly six feet high. In the square, children scream as the elderly and infirm watch with muted horror.
> 
> The torches to the west have been extinguished, the town’s western defenders fled—or killed. Only one figure remains standing: [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], his clothes torn and bloody, bearing a longsword in his left hand and a shortsword in his right. Twenty feet away from him stands a pale-skinned zombie, its flesh a smooth, sickly white that bulges with crimson veins. Its eyes stare dully toward the tents in the town square beyond, and, as a cloud of reddish mist spills gently from its gaping mouth, it takes a shambling step forward.

> [!combat]- Fight against Ismark's Last Stand
> [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], who has been reduced to 40 hit points, welcomes any help the players can provide against the plague spreader. If reduced to 30 hit points or fewer, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] obstructs the plague spreader directly while taking the Dodge action on each of his turns, hoping to delay it while providing the players sufficient time to defeat it.
> 
> The plague spreader, which begins 120 feet from the center of the town square and has the same modifications as the plague spreader in [[#The Siege]], won’t use its **_virulent miasma_** until it reaches the center of the town square or is reduced to 30 hit points or fewer. Each round, it attempts to move its full speed in a straight line toward the town square. If it can’t, it uses its **_multiattack_** to attack any creatures within reach. (The plague spreader doesn’t attempt to move around creatures obstructing it, even if doing so could allow it to reach its destination.)
> 
> This combat encounter is a **mild** combat encounter against a party of five 3rd-level players and a CR 3 ally ([[Ismark Kolyanovich]]), and will consume approximately 16% of their total maximum hit points. For parties of smaller or larger sizes, modify the encounter as follows:
> 
>> [!combat]- Three Players
>> Decrease the barovian zombie plague spreader’s hit points to 93, remove the necrotic damage from its Slam attacks, and decrease the damage of its virulent miasma to 2d4.

> As noted in Monsters and Death (Player's Handbook, p. 198), allied non-player characters—such as [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] and any other NPC fighting alongside the players—should fall unconscious upon being reduced to 0 hit points. When they do, they follow the same rules for death saving throws as player characters, described further in Death Saving Throws (Player's Handbook, p. 197).
#### Rahadin's Proclamation

Shortly after the players defeat the plague spreader, a lone horseman flanked by twelve **zombies** approaches the town square from the west.

> [!cutscene] As they approach, read:
> You hear the sound of hoofsteps squelching through mud. From the shadows on the western road emerges a cloaked man riding an ash-gray horse with dull, shadowed eyes. Behind it trail a dozen shambling undead, flanking the horseman with six to a side.
> 
> The flickering torchlight paints the man’s features in shades of burning orange and red, revealing a tall, lithe figure of dusky complexion, with long, black hair that falls past his neck. A light cloak is draped across his shoulders, its edge rimmed with thick, white fur, and gloves of supple black leather cover his hands. A deep blue tunic trimmed with bronze is visible beneath a layer of tough, yet flexible leather armor, and a curved saber hangs from a sheath at his belt, with a pair of scimitars strapped to his back above it.
> 
> His ears taper sharply upward to elven points, and his dark, brown eyes bear a quiet awareness and a casual, almost predatory gaze as they shift slowly across his surroundings. A long, wicked scar cuts across his forehead, just above where lines have begun to mark his face with age, and his lips are pulled back into a thin, perpetual frown.

This is [[Rahadin]], riding his _phantom steed_. As he comes to a halt at the edge of the town square, he pulls a scroll from his cloak and unfurls. 

> [!handout]- Rahadin - Character Art
> Character art for Rahadin
> ^RahadinCharacterImage

> [!cutscene] If not interrupted, he begins to read from it, his resonant voice carrying across the square:
> "Five score and seven days past, this people rose in unlawful rebellion against Strahd von Zarovich, Count of Barovia, Master of Castle Ravenloft, and Protector of the Balinok Mountains. For this treasonous act, this settlement has been met with righteous punishment, so that its inhabitants might learn the weight of their defiance.
>
> "Witnessed by the eyes of the dead and damned, this price has been extracted in blood, common and noble alike. Let it be known that on this day, the mercy of Strahd von Zarovich extends once more unto those who return to their fief and field—while those who continue in their folly shall be swept away as chaff before the wind."

If not prevented, [[Rahadin]] searches the crowd, his gaze finally settling on [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]. Leaving the undead behind, he approaches [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] on horseback.

As [[Rahadin]] approaches the players (or vice—versa), the players can hear the sounds of his **_deathly choir._**

> [!cutscene] When they do, read:
> It begins with a dull roar—a prickle at the edge of your awareness, like the washing of the ocean against the shore. As the man grows closer, however, the muffled sound grows ever-more insistent, amplifying and building upon itself—until it resolves from a more innocuous sound, almost like waves, into a torrent of screams.
> 
> Your ears fill with a cacophony of a thousand voices, pleading, suffering, dying: a psychic onslaught that crashes against your mind from every direction, leaving little room for thought. The man, however, remains unflinching—seemingly undisturbed by the symphony of screams that surrounds him.

The players can notice that any other [[Barovians]] within ten feet of [[Rahadin]] appear to be similarly disturbed. (Any [[Barovians]] beyond the ten—foot radius can’t hear the screams.) When [[Rahadin]] speaks, the screams somewhat recede—enough to allow him and others to be heard—but gain a notable accent of fear.

Upon approaching [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], [[Rahadin]] inspects him briefly, then states coldly: “Please accept my congratulations on your new position—and my condolences on your loss." Unless obstructed, he then turns his horse around and departs the village, once more trailed by the twelve **zombies**.

[[Rahadin]]’s initial proclamation leaves [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] stiff and stone-faced, but his subsequent greeting leaves [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] shell-shocked and frozen. Shortly after [[Rahadin]] departs, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] appears to process the weight of [[Rahadin]]’s words, releases a bellowing, wordless cry, and runs for [[#B5d. The Burgomaster's Mansion (E4)]]. (If [[Parriwimple]] is present, he urges the players to follow [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]].)

> [!example]- The Players Challenge Rahadin
> [[Rahadin]] takes little interest in the players. If challenged, he states merely that the siege was “the will of Strahd," and informs the players that it is “not for them to question the actions of their betters." If asked his identity, he shares only that he is [[Rahadin]], chamberlain of [[Castle Ravenloft]], and a humble servant of [[Strahd von Zarovich]].
> 
> If grappled, restrained, or attacked, [[Rahadin]] first commands them to “cease their foolishness," noting that “in the spirit of the night’s mercy, and in light of their foreign nature," he is not unwilling to overlook their disobedience on this single occasion. If the interfering player continues their interference, [[Rahadin]] swiftly and efficiently dispatches them.
> 
> Once an interfering player has been knocked unconscious, [[Rahadin]] uses the pommel of his sabre to slam their wrist, knee, or ribs, temporarily causing that player to gain the effects of one of the following Lingering Injuries (_Dungeon Master’s Guide_, p. 272): **Lose an Arm or Hand**, **Lose a Foot or Leg**, or **Internal Injury**. This injury lasts until the player has completed two long rests.

### B5h. Return to the Mansion
---
#### Strahd's Aftermath

If the players follow [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] to the burgomaster’s mansion (E4), they find its grounds abandoned and the front door ajar. Upon arriving, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] rushes inside, shouting for [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|his father]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]].

[[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and the players can find [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] in the first-floor parlour.

> [!cutscene] When they do, read:
> A red pool surrounds the burgomaster’s unmoving form, his glassy eyes staring unseeing toward the ceiling as blood drips from a long, elegant slash across his chest. Not far away, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] lies crumpled across the carpet beneath a boarded-up window, its ragged curtains drifting lazily in the cold wind.

Upon arriving, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] lets out a strangled cry of anguish, and immediately descends to cradle his father’s head in his hands.

[[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] is obviously dead. A player who inspects [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and checks her breath or pulse finds that she is alive, but pale and weak, with two bloody puncture wounds piercing the flesh of her neck.

Shortly after the players arrive, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] stirs awake, shrieking in despair when she sees her father’s corpse. If asked, she can share the following information, though she readily admits that her memory is hazy:

- As the siege progressed, she returned to the manor to retrieve a fresh quiver of crossbow bolts. As she returned to the door, she heard her father inviting someone to enter their home. (“Father’s voice sounded strange," she whispers, holding her arms to her chest. “He was calm—too calm—like someone else was speaking for him.")
- Though she doesn’t remember who the visitor was, she remembers a tall, gaunt silhouette; a deep, resonant voice; and a set of burning, hypnotic red eyes.
- The voice—a man’s—spoke to her, and her memory went blank. She remembers feeling a sudden, sharp pain on her neck, followed by the sound of her father shouting. As she fell into unconsciousness, she recalls hearing the voice murmur, “We shall meet again."

[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is horrified by her father’s death and the prospect that their home was visited by the Devil, [[Strahd von Zarovich]]. She is bewildered as to why [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] might kill her father but spare her, and is deeply disturbed by the prospect that she is somehow responsible for [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]]’s fate.

Once the players have sufficiently comforted the siblings, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] exhaustedly asks the players to remain at the mansion with [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] while he returns to the town square to ensure that any wounded [[Barovians]] are cared for.
“We will see to our father’s burial tomorrow," he adds, quietly. "And if you can—try to get some sleep. You've more than earned it."
#### The Argument
[[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] returns to the manor shortly before midnight. Shortly thereafter, any players who remain awake, or who have a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 15 or greater, overhear a muffled argument from the kitchen below.

The players can eavesdrop on this conversation with a successful DC 13 Dexterity (Stealth) check or a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check.

> [!cutscene] If they do, read:
> The murmurs from the next room are largely indistinct, obscured by the low groans of the old house's timbers. As you strain your ears, however, the siblings' words come slowly into focus.
> 
> Ireena's voice, sharp with indignation, pierces the silence. "You have no right, Ismark. You can't just decide to send me away, like I'm some kind of inconvenience! I'm Father's child as much as you, and our people need me to rebuild. You need me too!"
> 
> Ismark's reply is measured, though laced with an unmistakable note of worry. "The Devil has his sights set on you—and even if we don't believe the legend about women with red hair, others might. Barovia just isn't safe for you anymore."
> 
> A snort of defiance echoes from the other side of the thin wooden partition. "I am no coward, Ismark, and I will not abandon our friends and neighbors in their hour of need."
> 
> There's a pause. Then, Ismark says, quietly, "Gertruda left the village this morning. Alone."
> 
> You hear a ragged breath from Ireena's direction. "_Why?_"
> 
> "Her mother thinks she went to Vallaki—she was convinced that help from Vallaki is the only way to end our suffering," Ismark murmurs.
> 
> There's a long, suffering silence. Then—
> 
> Ismark seems to hesitate, his words slightly fumbled. "I'm not asking you to abandon them. But there are others who need your help. Think about our neighbors who fled for Vallaki. They need guidance, advocacy—and perhaps a leader to bring them home one day."
> 
> There is a long pause. Ireena's voice is low when she finally speaks—barely even audible. "I still don't like it."
> 
> Ismark's response is quiet. "It's your choice. I can't take that away from you. But after losing Father, I can't . . . I can't bear the thought of losing you too."
> 
> The silence that follows is palpable, weighted with unspoken emotions. Finally, Ireena's voice breaks it, fragile and quiet. "I will go. If only for you. And only if we bury Father first—together."

[[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] ascend the stairs a few moments later. A player with a passive Wisdom (Insight) score of 10 or more notices that both have blotchy, red eyes, as if from crying.

If confronted, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] can reluctantly share the following information:

- He no longer believes that Barovia, surrounded by suspicious neighbours and in the shadow of the [[Castle Ravenloft|Devil’s keep]], is safe for [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]].
- Instead, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] intends for [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to travel to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], a fortified town to the west. [[Arc D - St. Andral's Feast#D1. St Andral's Church (N1)|St Andral's Church]] is said to be hallowed ground, protecting its congregants from vampires and other undead.

When the player returns to their room, they can see two **swarms of bats**—[[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s spies—gathered on the eaves of a nearby house, watching silently from the darkness.
#### Morning at the Mansion

The players' rest at the mansion passes without incident. When they awaken the following morning shortly before dawn, they can find the burgomasters' corpse lying in a coffin in the living room. [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] are in the dining room, quietly drinking tea.
There is a slight odour of decay nearby the body (within 5ft.,) although the temperature of the night has prevented it from decaying too much. Players that inspect the body notice that its nose must have been bleeding this morning, although someone has cleaned it up the best they can.

When the players descend to the main floor, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] greet them and insists on fixing them bowls of goat's milk porridge and cups of chamomile tea for breakfast. While [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] busies herself in the kitchen, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] solemnly and apologetically asks the players for three favours.

##### Escorting Ireena
[[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] first quietly notes that [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] appears to have become a target for both the [[Strahd von Zarovich|Devil]] and her fellow villagers, and that he no longer believes [[The Village of Barovia|the village]], which lies directly beneath the shadow of [[Castle Ravenloft]], to be safe for her.

[[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] shares the information regarding his desire to bring her to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], and notes that [[Arc D - St. Andral's Feast#D1. St Andral's Church (N1)|St Andral's Church]] in [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] is said to be hallowed ground, protecting its congregants from vampires and other undead.

He bids the characters help him escort [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], located in the heart of the valley, beyond the view of [[Castle Ravenloft]] and (he hopes) beyond the reach of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]. [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] knows that moving [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is a gamble, since she's vulnerable to [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] when she is outside their home, but he has heard assertions from villagers and his father that [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] is well-defended.

Although he can't leave [[The Village of Barovia|Barovia]] due to his duties as his father's successor, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] asks the players if they would be willing to bring her to [[Arc D - St. Andral's Feast#D1. St Andral's Church (N1)|St Andral's Church]] in his stead.

> [!warning]- Clarifying Expectations
> _Curse of Strahd: Reloaded_ is a campaign about heroes. It's also a campaign about making allies, and the bonds and strength that grow from those alliances.
> 
> As such, while [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] is not an essential NPC to the campaign, a party that declines [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]'s request likely has mismatched expectations with the type of campaign you plan to run. If the players refuse to escort [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] to Vallaki, pause the game and check in with them to clarify and confirm expectations. If the players are still reluctant to bring Ireena with them, ask questions and discuss the issue further before resuming the game.
##### Seeking Madam Eva
[[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s attack on the village has only strengthened [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]'s belief that the Barovians must find some way of escaping the vampire's tyranny.
"We can't go on living like this," he croaks, his knuckles whitening as he stares into his mug. "I've heard how terrible things were a hundred years ago, before he went to sleep. Vampires lurking in every shadow. Parents and their children disappearing in the night. Rats and wolves and bats reporting our every move to the castle. Even if the Devil goes dormant again in fifty or sixty years' time, who would we be if we condemned our children and grandchildren to that same fate?"

Although he asks them to be discreet in doing so, so as to avoid drawing [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s wrath back down upon the village, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] asks the players to seek the wisdom of Madam Eva, a [[Vistani]] seer and sage who dwells at [[Arc C - Into the Valley#C4. Tser Pool (G)|Tser Pool]].
"If anyone might know how the Devil can be destroyed and our people freed," he murmurs, "it's her."

If the players agree to do so, the player with the highest passive Wisdom (Perception) score notices a **rat**—one of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s spies—watching them with rapt, malevolent, and intelligent interest from beneath a nearby piece of furniture. Once noticed, the rat immediately dashes toward the kitchen in a clear attempt to escape.

The players have one round to kill the rat as it scurries toward a large hole in the kitchen wall. If they fail to do so, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] skewers it with her rapier before it can do so, recognizing it as one of Strahd's spies.
##### Delivering the Coffin.
After asking his first two favours, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] asks the players to assist him and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] in carrying [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]]'s coffin to the church. If they do, the two siblings accompany the players to the church.
### B5i. The Barovian Church (E5)
---

> [!cutscene] When the players approach the church, read:
> Atop a slight rise, against the roots of the pillar stone that supports Castle Ravenloft, stands a gray, sagging edifice of stone and wood. This church has obviously weathered the assaults of evil for centuries on end and is worn and weary. A bell tower rises toward the back, and flickering light shines through holes in the shingled roof. The rafters strain feebly against their load.

When the players arrive at the church with the burgomaster’s body, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] is disturbed by the damage wrought to its walls and roof.

> [!cutscene] When the players approach the door, read:
> The heavy wooden doors of the church are covered with claw marks and scarred by fire.

Give the players a moment to collect themselves. [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] then knocks on the front door and calls for [[Father Donavich]].

> [!cutscene]  If Parriwimple is still alive, read the following:
> As Ismark's knock echoes through the cold air, a voice rings out from the darkened street:
> "He won't come out."
> 
> A hulking silhouette steps forward from the mist—[[Parriwimple]].

> [!cutscene] If Bildrath died in the siege, add:
> [[Parriwimple]]'s clothes are still disheveled and bloodstained, and his cheeks are blotchy and red.
> Contents

[[Parriwimple]], who is out for a walk ("It helps me think," he mumbles, if asked), can share the following information if asked:

- [[Father Donavich]] used to be a kind and friendly man, always ready to share a word of wisdom or a warm crabapple pie with visitors.
- Ever since the siege started, however, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] shut himself inside the church and turned away visitors more often than not. When [[Parriwimple]] last saw him two days ago, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] looked like he hadn’t slept or bathed in almost a week.
- [[Father Donavich]] hasn’t worn his holy symbol (a bronze sunburst) since the rebellion, which [[Parriwimple]] considers odd. ([[Parriwimple]] always loved how the light would glint off of its surface, and adored hearing [[Father Donavich|Donavich]]’s son, [[Doru]], tell stories of how the sun once shone in Barovia.)
- [[Parriwimple]] misses [[Doru]], who left to lead the rebellion against [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] three months ago alongside the stranger, [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Alanik]]. ([[Parriwimple]] also misses [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Alanik]]’s pet monkey, which he loved to play with.) Despite his uncle telling him that [[Doru]] died at [[Castle Ravenloft]], [[Parriwimple]] hopes that he somehow survived.

[[Parriwimple]] won’t accompany the players inside of the church, but wishes them well and invites them to visit him at [[#B5e. Bildrath's Mercantile (E1)|Bildrath’s Mercantile]] before departing.
#### Inside the Church
##### E5a. Hall
> [!cutscene] When the players enter the church, read:
> The doors open to reveal a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-long hall leading to a brightly lit chapel. The hall is unlit and reeks of mildew. Four doors, two on each side of the hall, lead to adjacent chambers.
> 
> You can see that the chapel is strewn with debris, and you hear a soft voice from within reciting a prayer.

The soft voice uttering the prayer belongs to [[Father Donavich]], the priest in [[#E5f. Chapel]].

> [!warning]- Design note: Doru's disposition
> Doru does not cry out to his father when the players enter the chapel due to the change in his backstory and this his disposition.
> As such his screams have been removed from all descriptions in the Church.
##### E5f. Chapel
When the players first approach the chapel, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]]’s prayers halt, hearing them enter.

> [!cutscene] When the group approaches the chapel, read:
> The chapel is a shambles, with overturned and broken pews littering the dusty floor. Dozens of candles mounted in candlesticks and candelabras light every dusty corner in a fervent attempt to rid the chapel of shadows. At the far end of the church sits a claw-scarred altar, behind which kneels a priest in soiled vestments. Next to him hangs a long, thick rope that stretches up into the bell tower.
> 
> The sound of mumbled prayer stops, and a hoarse, tired voice rings through the chamber from the figure kneeling behind the altar.
> 
> “I cannot offer the blessing you seek. Go, and leave this accursed place in peace."

> [!info]- A Recent History of the Church
> [[Father Donavich]] was no supporter of [[Doru]]’s march on [[Castle Ravenloft]]. A mild and soft-spoken man, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] feared that [[Doru]] would meet only his end beyond the walls of the keep. To keep his son safe, however, and as a token of his love, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] gave [[Doru]] his holy symbol, as well as his blessing.
> 
> [[Father Donavich|Donavich]]’s holy symbol, however, did little to protect his son. When [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] began his siege on [[the village of Barovia]] six nights ago, his undead forces were not alone: [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] also sent [[Doru]], now a freshly turned **vampire spawn**, to terrorize the church and torment his father. [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] barely managed to lure and trap [[Doru]] in the [[#E5g. Undercroft]], where he remains imprisoned still.
> 
> Since [[Doru]] returned, [[Father Donavich]] has been unable to cast any spells and no longer feels the [[Church of the Morninglord|Church of the Morninglord]]’s presence when he prays. When [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] sent [[Doru]] back to [[The Village of Barovia|Barovia]], he allowed [[Doru]] to continue wearing his father’s holy symbol as a cruel joke. As a result, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] wrongly believes that [[Doru]]’s undead nature has corrupted his symbol—and, therefore, his relationship with the [[Church of the Morninglord|Church of the Morninglord]]—and so prevented him from reaching the [[Church of the Morninglord|Church of the Morninglord]]’s divine grace.
> 
> In fact, however, it is [[Father Donavich]]’s own loss of faith that hinders him—a crisis that blinds him to an even starker truth. [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] believes that his son, [[Doru]], is dead, and that the **vampire spawn** trapped in the [[#E5g. Undercroft]] is a foul and profane beast that wears [[Doru]]’s skin. He is mistaken: though his body is now undead, [[Doru]]’s soul is very much alive.
> 
> Though he cannot ignore [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s direct commands, and though his thirst for blood weighs heavily on his thoughts and actions, [[Doru]] continues to fight bitterly against his own vampiric nature. Though he doesn’t always succeed, it was this resistance that allowed his father to entrap him in the [[#E5g. Undercroft]] at all. When hope rises in him, [[Doru]] calls out to his father to release him, pleading for salvation and forgiveness. [[Father Donavich|Donavich]], however, has so far refused to respond.
> 
> [[Doru]] continues to wear his father’s holy symbol, both to reassure himself that they will one day reconcile and to steel his will when the vampire’s urges rise too strongly within. His ability to resist the call of blood has slowly grown since his imprisonment—but so too has his exhaustion, exacerbated by slow starvation. Now, [[Doru]]’s sanity balances on a knife’s edge, and a simple push could mean salvation—or damnation.

If he learns that [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] are with the players, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] acts more warmly toward them and apologizes for the chapel’s state of disrepair.

As the conversation unfolds, the following exchanges might occur:

- If [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], or a player asks about burying the deceased [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Burgomaster]], [[Father Donavich]] informs them that he would be glad to oversee a burial, but that he cannot perform the holy rites that would sanctify [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]]’s remains. ([[Father Donavich|Donavich]] is sorrowful to hear of [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]]’s death, and expresses his condolences for his passing.)
- If [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], or a player notes the damage done to the church, [[Father Donavich]] informs them that it was caused by a **vampire spawn** that attacked amidst the siege—the undead husk of his son, [[Doru]]. (Both [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] are shocked and horrified to learn of [[Doru]]'s fate, having believed he died at [[Castle Ravenloft]].)
- If [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]], [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], or a player informs him that [[Gertruda]] ([[Doru]]'s betrothed) has gone missing, [[Father Donavich]] mourns her and murmurs a quiet prayer that the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]] keep and protect her soul.

If the players inquire further, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] can share the following information:

- When [[Doru]] set off for [[Castle Ravenloft]], [[Father Donavich]] gave him his holy symbol of the Morninglord—a bronze sunburst on a leather cord—to keep him safe in the face of darkness. When [[Doru]] failed to return, however, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] feared the worst.
- Six days ago, as the siege was beginning, [[Doru]] returned to the church at midnight, now transformed into a **vampire spawn**. [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] managed to lure [[Doru]] into the [[#E5g. Undercroft]] and trap him there.
- Ever since [[Doru]] returned, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] hasn’t been able to cast spells or feel the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]]’s presence. He believes that this is because [[Doru]] still has his holy symbol, and that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s foul influence has corrupted [[Father Donavich|Donavich]]’s connection to the gods.
- [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] believes that his son is dead, and that the creature that wears his skin is a mockery that must be destroyed.

[[Father Donavich|Donavich]] knows that he can’t defeat [[Doru]] and can’t bear to see his son’s face again. If the players are willing, however, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] asks them to descend to the [[#E5g. Undercroft]], destroy [[Doru]]’s body, and retrieve his holy symbol. In exchange, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] offers to complete the proper burial rites and to tell the players of a place where they can find safety from the [[Strahd von Zarovich|Devil Strahd]].

If the players agree, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] produces the key to the padlock in [[#E5d. Trapdoor]] and allows them to enter. ([[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] remains upstairs with [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], reluctant to expose her to a vampire—even [[Doru]]—but promises the players that he will join them should [[Doru]] prove too dangerous for them to handle.
A DC 12 Wisdom (Insight) check reveals that he also appears too horrified by [[Doru]]'s fate to face him directly.)
##### E5b. Doru's Bedroom
There is little reason for the players to enter here, but [[Father Donavich]] doesn't object to them having a look around. 

> [!cutscene] When the players enter, read:
> This dirty, lightless room contains a wooden bed with a straw-filled mattress. Mounted above the bed's headboard is a wooden holy symbol.

This room once belonged to [[Doru]]. It hasn't been used since [[Doru]] left for [[Castle Ravenloft]] and contains nothing of value.
##### E5c. Donavich's Bedroom
There is little reason for the players to enter here, but [[Father Donavich]] doesn't object to them having a look around. 

> [!cutscene] When the players enter, read:
> This dirty room contains a wooden bed with a straw-filled mattress, next to which rests a small table with an oil lamp burning brightly on it. Mounted above the bed's headboard is a wooden sun-shaped holy symbol.

This is Donavich's room and contains nothing of value.
##### E5d. Trapdoor
> [!cutscene] When the players enter, read:
> Time and neglect have punched holes in the ceiling of this moldy room, which contains a few broken roof shingles amid puddles of water. In one corner, set into the floor, is a heavy wooden trapdoor held shut with a chain and a padlock.

Thanks to the recent weather and autumn climate, the trapdoor is swollen and stuck in its frame, so that a successful DC 12 Strength check is required to pull it open.

Below it is a wooden staircase that descends 15 feet into the [[#E5g. Undercroft]].
##### E5e. Office
There is little reason for the players to enter here, but [[Father Donavich]] doesn't object to them having a look around. 

> [!cutscene] When the players enter, read:
> An old desk and chair stand against the south wall, a wooden holy symbol mounted above them—a sunburst. A ten-foot-long iron rod attached to the north wall stands bare, suggesting a tapestry once hung there. Against the far wall stands a wooden cabinet with four tall doors.

An empty wooden poor box rests on the seat of the chair. The desk drawers contain a few sheets of blank parchment, along with a couple of quill pens and dried-up jars of ink.

For its size, the wooden cabinet contains very little. Inside are a tinderbox, a few wooden boxes full of candles, and two well-used books: _Hymns to the Dawn_, a volume of chants to the [[Church of the Morninglord|Morninglord]], and _The Blade of Truth: The Uses of Logic in the War Against Diabolist Heresies, as Fought by the Ulmist Inquisition_, a strange book that mixes logic exercises with lurid descriptions of fiend-worshiping cults.
#### Descent to the Undercroft

##### E5g. Undercroft

> [!cutscene] When the players enter, read:
> The church's undercroft has rough-hewn walls and a floor made of damp clay and earth. Rotting wooden pillars strain under the weight of the wooden ceiling. Candlelight from the chapel above slips through the cracks, but there's no sign of any creature in the gloom.

[[Doru]], a **vampire spawn**, has used his **_spider climb_** feature to cling to the ceiling at the sound of the players’ approach. A player with a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 16 or higher automatically spots him in the darkened upper corner on the far side of the room.

> [!cutscene] Otherwise, read the following after one round has passed:
> A young man’s voice, strained and tired, echoes from the darkness above.
> 
> “You’ve come to kill me, haven’t you?"

[[Doru]] prefers to speak with the players from the safety of darkness, but won’t refuse if the players command him to reveal himself.

> [!cutscene] If he does, read:
> From the darkness of the cross beams above, a figure unfurls itself like a moth from its cocoon, moving like a spider as it lowers itself slowly to the ground. As it comes into the faint light, the shadow resolves into the form of a young man, his youthful features strikingly reminiscent of Father Donavich.
> 
> His skin is ghostly pale, with dirt and grime streaked across his face. His clothes are ripped and worn, and his hair is an unkempt mess of tangles and knots. His eyes are red and bloodshot, his gaze darting from face to face. A leather cord hangs around his neck, holding a bloodstained bronze sunburst that rests against his chest. He swallows and licks his lips—and a pair of pointed fangs pokes through.
> 
> "If you want to kill me, I won't stop you," he says, his voice cracking. "But I just have one request first."

> [!handout]- "Doru" by Caleb Cleveland
> ![[Doru by Caleb Cleveland.jpg]]
> ^DorubyCalebCleveland

> [!info]- Doru Will Remember That
> When the players’ conversation with Doru begins, secretly place a six-sided die on the table, with its top face showing a one. Each time the players antagonize or discourage Doru, increase the number on the die by one. Each time the players are encouraging or kind, decrease the number on the die by one. (The number can’t go below zero or above six.)
> 
> If the players agree to perform Doru’s experiment, roll a second six-sided die when the experiment begins. If the result on the second die is equal to or greater than the number on the first, Doru resists his vampiric addiction and the test ends successfully. If the result on the second die is less than the number on the first, however, Doru succumbs to his bloodlust and attacks the source of the blood.
> 
> For example, if the players antagonize Doru twice and offer no kindness or encouragement, the first die should show a three. If the second die rolls a one or a two, Doru attacks.
> ^DoruWillRememberThat

[[Doru]]’s request is simple: to prove to himself that he can control his vampiric urges, he wants the players to expose him to the scent of fresh blood. If he can refrain from attacking for a full minute, he wants the players to tell [[Father Donavich]] that his son is still alive. If he can’t, he wants the players to kill him. In either case, he won’t stop the players from taking the holy symbol once the experiment is complete.

> [!example]- The Players Attack
> [[Doru]] doesn't fight to defend himself if attacked. Instead, he curls into a ball at the end of the room and pleads for the players to give him a chance—just one chance—to prove himself. If the players decline, [[Doru]] whimpers for his father to save him as he dies, though his pleas go unheard and unheeded.

[[Doru]] can also share the following information with the players if asked:

- As a child, [[Doru]] was enraptured by stories of the sun and the light and hope that it once brought to the valley. As he grew older, he learned swordsmanship from [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and studied the book _Van Richten’s Guide to Vampires_ to learn how to destroy the undead. He dreamed of one day destroying the [[Strahd von Zarovich|Devil]] of [[Castle Ravenloft]] and bringing freedom to his people.
  
- Sixteen weeks ago, a foreign scholar calling himself [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Alanik Ray]] arrived in Barovia and rented a room in the burgomaster's manor. When an enormous undead dire wolf attacked a group of children who had strayed too far from the village, however, [[Doru]] alone saw "Alanik" fend it off with expert skill—and when the wolf knocked the hat off of "Alanik's" head, his appearance magically changed, revealing him to be the legendary vampire hunter [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten]].
  
- [[Doru]] confronted him and insisted that [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]] lead the village in revolt against [[Castle Ravenloft]]. Though [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]] was reluctant at first, he eventually agreed—on the condition that [[Doru]] allow him to keep his disguise. Two days later, [[Doru]], aided by a man named [[Escher]]—the village bard and [[Doru]]’s oldest friend—had assembled more than two dozen fighters to march on the keep.
  
- With [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]]’s aid, the mob struck down any undead guards that tried to stand in their way. However, when they finally opened [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s crypt, [[Escher]] was nowhere to be found—and [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s coffin was empty. (If asked, [[Doru]] forcefully denies that Escher betrayed them.)
  
- Shortly thereafter, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] emerged from the shadows and attacked the mob with merciless force. Most of [[Doru]]’s companions were slain. [[Doru]] himself was turned into a vampire spawn, and later learned that [[Escher]] had been as well. [[Doru]] doesn’t know what happened to [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]], but was forced to confess the old man’s identity when [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] interrogated him later.
  
- [[Doru]] spent nearly three months at [[Castle Ravenloft]], during which [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] repeatedly forced him to drink the blood of his former companions. Six nights ago, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] commanded [[Doru]] to return to the church and his father.
  
- [[Doru]] can’t disobey [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s direct orders, and can feel his presence at all times. His vampiric bloodthirst is a constant distraction, and it’s difficult to control his predatory urges and instincts. When he first returned to the church, he was almost grateful that his father had locked him in the undercroft, where he couldn’t do any harm.
  
- [[Doru]] doesn’t know if his soul or body can be saved, but he’s kept his father’s holy symbol to remind him of his faith and family, and to steel his will against the addictions of his new form. If not for that, he suspects that he would have lost control days or even weeks ago. ([[Doru]] doesn’t know why [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] allowed him to keep it, but suspects that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] viewed it as a form of ironic amusement.)

If the players ask about his argument with "Alanik," [[Doru]] admits, shamefacedly, that he forced [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]] to accompany his rebels to the castle, threatening to march on [[Castle Ravenloft]] with or without [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]]'s help. (An enraged [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]] ripped out the preface of [[Doru]]'s copy of _Van Richten's Guide to Vampires_—which [[Doru]] bought from a [[Vistani]] caravan ten years prior—in order to make a point. "He warned me that faith and books meant nothing in the face of true evil," [[Doru]] murmurs. "I should have listened." [[Doru]] isn't sure what happened to the rest of the book.)

As the conversation continues, [[Doru]] might ask the players:

- whether [[Escher]] has been seen in the village, and
- whether [[Doru]]’s betrothed, [[Gertruda]], survived the siege.

If told that [[Gertruda]] has left [[The Village of Barovia|the village]] alone for [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]]—likely in a misguided effort to save [[Doru]] himself—[[Doru]] becomes visibly distraught, but hopes aloud that she made the journey safely. He asks the players to look out for her and help bring her home should they find her. [[Doru]] feels that he has earned his fate, but believes that [[Gertruda]], a good and compassionate woman, deserves far better.
#### Doru's Trial

If the players agree to fulfill [[Doru]]’s request by exposing him to fresh blood, he asks them to remain silent while he resists—and to strike him down if he succumbs.

> [!cutscene] When the trial begins, read:
> Doru’s muscles tense and he squeezes his eyes shut. A few moments later, his nostrils flare, and a thin line of saliva begins to run down his lips. He whimpers, his clawed fingers flexing and twitching.
> 
> "When the shadows come," he whispers, “I will not yield. Darkness is the destroyer, and temptation its weapon. I will face the night and its horrors and await the horizon. For in the light of the Morninglord's love, only light can remain."
> 
> Doru's voice shakes, his emaciated body trembling. One fist is clenched at his side, the other squeezing the bloodstained sunburst that lies across his neck.
> 
> "In the light of the Morninglord's love," he repeats, gasping for breath. "In the light of the Morninglord's love. Gertruda. Gertruda. **_Gertruda_** —"

At this point, roll the d6 as described in [[#^DoruWillRememberThat|Doru will Remember That]]. Either roll it yourself behind the screen, or publicly for players to see.

If Doru succumbs to the bloodlust (see [[#^DoruWillRememberThat|Doru will Remember That]] above), he pauses, then attacks. 

Roll initiative. 

> [!combat]- Fight against Doru
>During the combat, [[Doru]] begs for forgiveness as he attacks.
>```encounter

>creatures:
>  - ["Doru, the Vampire Spawn"]
>```
> > [!combat]- Doru, the Vampire Spawn - Statistics
> > ```statblock
> > creature: Doru, the Vampire Spawn
> > ```

Otherwise, if [[Doru]] successfully resists the bloodlust, pause for dramatic effect.

> [!cutscene] Then, read:
> After what seems like an eternity, Doru's body finally relaxes. His tense muscles seem to uncoil, his breath grows steadier, and the look of strain fades from his face. His eyes remain closed a moment longer, then flutter open—and the fangs in his mouth slowly retract, leaving only an ordinary pair of canines behind.
> 
> "I have not yielded," he whispers hoarsely. "Not yet."

Give the players a chance to react, but make it obvious that [[Doru]] is in control of his urges for now.

[[Doru]] thanks the players and relinquishes the holy symbol without protest. If the players mention it, he is surprised to hear that his fangs have retracted, but recognizes the significance with humility and disbelief. ([[Doru]] has, after all, read _Van Richten's Guide to Vampires_ many times.)

[[Doru]] warns the players that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] will likely take an active interest in newcomers to his land, and that they should therefore be careful. As a token of his gratitude, he provides the players with the location of a hidden weapons cache that [[Dr. Rudolph van Richten|Van Richten]] kept in case of emergencies. To reach it, the players must cross the River Ivlis Bridge and travel down the Old Svalich Road three hundred paces south into the woods, until they arrive at an [[Arc C - Into the Valley#C1b. Van Richten's Cache|ancient oak tree]]. They'll find the cache nestled in a hollow beneath the tree's roots.

If the players appear interested in learning more about vampires, [[Doru]] can share the information contained in **Born from Death** and **Chained to the Grave** in Vampire (Monster Manual, p. 297), as well as the broad details of the **shapechanger***, **regeneration***, and **vampire weaknesses*** features of the **vampire** statblock. [[Doru]] notes, however, that the [[Strahd von Zarovich|Devil]] is unlike any other vampire. "He holds powers beyond any ordinary vampire's ken. He is . . . unfathomable." He shudders, his eyes squeezing shut in painful remembrance. ([[Doru]] can't share any specifics regarding [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]'s capabilities, only that he seemed to slaughter [[Doru]]'s friends "in mere moments.")

Before the players depart, [[Doru]] asks them once more to tell [[Father Donavich]] that his son is still alive. If asked to accompany them upstairs, he declines to do so. "I have sinned with my hubris, and this is my penance," he says softly. "I will leave this prison only when my father allows."
#### The Burial

If the players return to [[Father Donavich]] with his holy symbol in hand, he accepts it with gratitude.

> [!cutscene] If the players tell Father Donavich that they killed Doru to obtain the symbol, read:
> Donavich's eyes well up with tears as he clasps the symbol in his hands, holding it so tightly his knuckles begin to turn white. A strangled sob escapes him as he sinks to his knees, cradling the sunburst like an infant.
> 
> "My boy—my dear, precious boy," he murmurs, his voice barely above a whisper. "May the Morninglord forgive me for what I've done—and for what I couldn't do."
> 
> He swallows and his face tenses, his expression growing as hard as stone. "It had to be done. For his sake—and ours."

Alternatively,

> [!cutscene] If the players spared Doru and relay his final message, read:
> Donavich stumbles back as if he's been struck, his face pale and his eyes wide with shock. For a moment, he simply stands there, silent—and then the silence is broken by a pained noise, a cross between a gasp and a sob, as he clutches the symbol to his chest.
> 
> His eyes glisten as he runs a trembling hand through his hair, a myriad of emotions playing across his face in quick succession: disbelief, rage, grief, shame, and—finally—hope. He sags against a nearby pew, his body shaking with exertion.
> 
> "My boy," he chokes out. "He's—he's still my boy?"

Once he’s received his holy symbol, [[Father Donavich]] gladly agrees to conduct [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]]’s burial.

##### E6. Cemetery

> [!cutscene] When the players approach, read:
> A fence of wrought iron with a rusty gate encloses a rectangular plot of land behind the dilapidated church. Tightly packed gravestones shrouded by fog bear the names of souls long passed. All seems quiet.

At night, it is watched by two **swarms of bats**—spies of [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s—who hang to the eaves of the church and the nearby mausoleums, watching the players.

Upon entering the cemetery, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] retrieves four shovels from a shed abutting the church and shares them with the players.

> [!cutscene] When the grave is fully dug and dawn has begun, Donavich offers prayers to the Morninglord, asking for Kolyan’s deliverance in the following refrain:
> *O Morninglord*
> 
> *Lord of blessed light and patron of new beginnings*
> 
> *We commend into thy mercy and thy radiance Master Kolyan Indirovich*
> 
> *Now departed hence from us and gone evermore into your glory.*
> 
> *We beseech thee to grant unto him thy mercy and everlasting peace*
> 
> *As thou deliver'st him from this everlasting darkness into infinite light*
> 
> *From pestilence into growth*
> 
> *From shadow into day*
> 
> *And from death into new life.*
> 
> *Grant him entrance into Your land of light and joy*
> 
> *In the fellowship of thy saints*
> 
> *And the brilliance of thy presence*
> 
> *By Your will and grace.*

At the conclusion of [[Father Donavich|Donavich]]’s prayer, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] and [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] offer words in memory of their father.

> [!cutscene] As they speak, read:
> Ismark wipes his eyes. "Kolyan Indirovich bore all the qualities of a great burgomaster: he was kind, compassionate, and just. But above all else, he was our father—the man who taught us to choose courage over fear, hope over despair, and laughter over sorrow. Even though he has left us, his lessons and memory never will. May he find rest in the Morninglord's embrace, and may his legacy be never forgotten."
> 
> Ireena stares at the grave for a few moments, her fingers twisting anxiously into knots. Finally, she says, quietly, "When you found me, I was a stranger—a child, lost in the woods. You and Mother took me in, cared for me, and loved me as your own. When I asked you why, you only ever said: Because I needed it." She falters, choking on the words, then says: "I can never hope to repay what you gave me. But, just as you did, I will never stop trying to help those who need it."

Any players who wish to may offer words, prayers, or tributes of their own.

If he has recovered his holy symbol, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] first casts _gentle repose_ to sanctify [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]]’s remains. [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] then directs the players to lower the coffin into the ground.

With the burial concluded, [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]]’s bats take off into the air, vanishing up into the mist surrounding the base of [[Castle Ravenloft]].

[[Father Donavich|Donavich]] takes the bats’ presence as a bad omen. In a surprisingly lucid moment, he warns the players and [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] of a [[Barovians#Beliefs and Superstitions|Barovian superstition]] that young women with red hair often find that ill luck travels beside them, and asks if [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] plans to remain in Barovia now that the [[Strahd von Zarovich|Devil]] has awoken. If told that [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and the players intend to leave, [[Father Donavich|Donavich]] suggests the [[Arc K - The Fallen Abbey|Abbey of St. Markovia]] in [[The Village of Krezk|Krezk]] as an eventual destination. He notes it was once a bastion of good, and may yet still offer some protection.

> [!info]- Who Knows of the Abbey?
> All Barovians know that the Abbey of St. Markovia lies in the village of Krezk. Most outside of Krezk are unsure as to whether it still operates, though rumors abound that [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] destroyed it long ago, leaving nothing more than ghosts to haunt its halls. A few Vallakians, including Father Lucian Petrovich of St. Andral's Church, know that the Abbey was reopened more than one hundred years ago, but none beyond Krezk know that the Abbey's current abbot is the same man who reopened its doors over a century ago.
#### Return to the Mansion

When the players return to [[#B5d. The Burgomaster's Mansion (E4)]] following the burial, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] packs them three days' worth of rations in cloth sacks for the journey to come. As he does, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] tells the players that she'll be ready to leave at noon. Until then, the players are free to explore [[The Village of Barovia|the village]], shop at [[#B5e. Bildrath's Mercantile (E1)|Bildrath's Mercantile]], or otherwise pass the time.

As [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] packs the rations, he can share the following information:

- The journey to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]] is more than a day's travel if the players plan to visit [[Arc C - Into the Valley#C4. Tser Pool (G)|Tser Pool]] first, and that [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and the players will likely need to spend a night on the road. He recommends doing so at [[Arc C - Into the Valley#C4. Tser Pool (G)|Tser Pool]] itself.
- [[Arc C - Into the Valley#C4. Tser Pool (G)|Tser Pool]] is a bit under two hours' journey from [[The Village of Barovia|Barovia]]. (Though some [[Vistani]] are rumoured to be in league with [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]], [[Arc C - Into the Valley#C4. Tser Pool (G)|Tser Pool]] is known to be a safe place for travelers to spend the night, especially given [[Madam Eva]]'s reputation.)
### B5j. Lugdana's Knoll
---
Approximately an hour before noon, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] quietly slips out of the mansion, walking to Lugdana's Knoll, a small, quiet hill to the north of [[The Village of Barovia|Barovia]]. (The hill is named for the paladin [[Lugdana]], who, according to legend, first met Burgomaster [[Ismark, the Great|Ismark Antonovich the Great]] upon that hill.)

Shortly before noon, if the players haven't been keeping track of her, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]]—who's currently debriefing a pair of Barovian **scouts** regarding their unsuccessful search for [[Gertruda]]—notes [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s absence with minor concern and asks the players to find her and bring her home.

Because [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] and his servants have only visited at night, [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] isn't notably alarmed by [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s absence, but still wants to see her brought home as quickly as reasonably possible. [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] advises that the players check Lugdana's Knoll first—one of [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s favourite spots around the village—and provides brief directions to get there.

> [!cutscene] If the players visit the knoll, read:
> As you pass through the sea of tall grasses north of the village, a gentle knoll rises before you, bordered on the far side by the clutches of the dark Svalich Wood. Plants with white, feathery flowers and a sweet, earthy scent seem to dance amidst the grass atop the hill, their leaves rustling in a whispering wind.
> 
> A lonely tree stands atop the hill, its gnarled branches reaching skyward like outstretched arms. Beneath its shade kneels a female figure, her gaze fixated upon the ground.

The figure is [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], who has donned her chestplate and rapier and now wears a red scarf around her neck. As the players approach, they can see that she is using a trowel to dig a hole in the earth between the tree's roots. [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], fixated upon her work, doesn't notice the players until they call out to her or otherwise enter her field of view.

[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] greets the players with warmth, though with some embarrassment for having driven them to come search for her. She shares freely that she is digging for a small wooden chest that she and her mother, [[Korina Targolova]], buried here before her mother's death fourteen years ago—a coffer whose contents she hopes to take as a keepsake when she departs for [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], given that she doesn't know when, if ever, she'll be able to return home.

If allowed to finish unearthing the chest, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] opens it, revealing its contents.
The chest contains a silver bracelet set with gemstones, a pressed aster flower, a wooden charm in the shape of the yarrow flower on a leather cord, and a handkerchief with floral patterns.

The flower (which [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] found and her mother pressed), charm (which [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s mother wore as an apprentice to the town's healer), and handkerchief (which [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s mother helped her to sew) are all mementos of [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s childhood with her mother. The bracelet is an item that [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] was found carrying when [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] found her in the [[#B3. Svalich Woods (C)|Svalich Wood]], which [[Korina Targolova|Korina]] kept as a memento of their "miracle child" after she learned that she could bear no more children.

The bracelet holds no sentimental value for [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], and she doesn't remember why she was carrying it when [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|Kolyan]] first found her, or where she obtained it. She offers it to the players as a gift for their agreement to escort her to [[The Town of Vallaki|Vallaki]], as compensation for their trouble.

The silver bracelet, which is tarnished and clearly hundreds of years old, is worth 100 gp and bears an intricate pattern of the moon and stars along the exterior, with a moonstone gem embedded at the centre of the moon and five lapis-lazuli serving as the stars. On the inside of the bracelet, in tiny, elegant script, the following message is engraved in Common:

"Tatyana: May you find your path, and may you find light even in the darkest places—Mother & Father."

[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] doesn't know who [[Tatyana Federovna|Tatyana]] is. (Unbeknownst to [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]], the bracelet was a gift from [[Tatyana Federovna]]'s parents on [[Tatyana Federovna|Tatyana]]'s eighteenth birthday. It was lost in the [[#B3. Svalich Woods (C)|Svalich Wood]] when [[Tatyana Federovna|Tatyana]] leapt to her death from the [[Castle Ravenloft]] overlook.)

After sharing the items in the chest, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] removes her scarf, revealing the bite marks on her neck. As she traces her fingers along them, she grimaces.
"I don't know why he hasn't killed me or turned me," she says, gritting her teeth as her hands curl into fists. "I don't know if this is some kind of sick game he's playing, or if he just likes to see people suffer."

The anger leaves her as she adds, her voice tightening, "They say women with red hair bring bad luck. I'm sorry—I never wanted to bring any to you." (She is grateful for any reassurances the players might offer.)

[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] gladly returns to the mansion with the players, or returns on her own shortly after noon if the players failed to find her. She then retrieves a packed traveling bag from her room.

When the players are ready to leave, [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] bids [[Ismark Kolyanovich|Ismark]] a heartfelt farewell and sets off on the road.

**_Milestone_**. Defending [[The Village of Barovia|the village]] and burying [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich|the Burgomaster]] completes a story milestone.
If the players depart [[The Village of Barovia|Barovia]] with [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] accompanying them, award each player 400 XP.
If [[Doru]] successfully passed his test of will, award each player an additional 100 XP.

> [!info]+ Ireena Joins the Party
> [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] has the statistics of an **expert sidekick (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything, p. 142)**, using the base stat block of a **noble**, and carries a light crossbow (+3 to hit, range 80/320 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 5 (1d8 + 1) piercing damage). She also has the Healer (Player's Handbook, p. 167) feat, and begins with two _healer's kits_.
> 
> [[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s starting level is the same as the average level of the party at the time she first joins them. She begins with additional proficiencies in History, Investigation, Medicine, Perception, and Stealth, and proficiency in Dexterity saving throws. When she first joins the party at 3rd level, she has 25 (5d8) hit points.

#### B5k. Mad Mary's Townhouse
---
There should be no reason for the players to visit Mad Mary’s Townhouse in this revision. However, if they do, the following changes have been made:

[[Mad Mary]] did not hide [[Gertruda]] in this house for her entire life. Instead, [[Gertruda]] lived a fairly ordinary life—albeit one with a fairly overbearing widowed mother. ([[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]] and [[Gertruda]] initially bonded as young girls over the loss of their parents—[[Ireena Kolyana|Ireena]]'s mother and [[Gertruda]]'s father.) When he was alive, [[Gertruda]]’s father was a merchant who raised [[Gertruda]] on stories of great lords and ladies, using their family’s meagre funds to purchase her occasional books from [[Vistani]] caravans regarding diplomacy and military history.

The first floor of this old, dirty dwelling comprises a one-room divided living space. To the north lies a small kitchen, its countertops dirty and covered with dust. There is a broken glass on the floor and a rotted meal for two set on a table covered with a dirty blue tablecloth. ([[Mad Mary|Mary]] poured herself a glass of wine to steady her nerves after realizing [[Gertruda]]'s disappearance, and dropped it on the floor in anguish.)

A small sitting area to the south contains a fireplace, two comfortable armchairs, and a dirty rug. Stairs lead up from here to the second floor.

The second floor corridor contains three wooden doors. One leads to a bathroom with an unemptied chamber pot and a bowl of dirty bathwater. Another leads to [[Mad Mary]]’s bedroom, which holds a writing desk and a bed. (If found here, [[Mad Mary|Mary]] is sitting on the bed, quietly sobbing.)

The third door, which is slightly ajar, leads to [[Gertruda]]’s bedroom; a tray holding a broken tea kettle and cup has shattered on the floor before it. ([[Mad Mary]] was bringing [[Gertruda]] tea when she found her daughter missing, and dropped it in horror.)

[[Gertruda]]'s room holds a clumsily handwoven dress and a shelf holding a dozen well-read, dog-eared books, as well as a hairbrush, a rug, and an open window.
# Design Notes: Welcome to Barovia

## Not your typical Arrival in Barovia
---
The players’ arrival in [[the village of Barovia]] has been substantially reworked to create a strong inciting incident for the campaign, ensuring they have an immediate and concrete reason to seek out [[Madam Eva]]’s Tarokka reading, an opportunity to form relationships with [[Barovians|the villagers of Barovia]], and personalized stakes in seeing [[Strahd von Zarovich|Strahd]] defeated.
## Fear not the choices, only their consequences
---
There are many key choices that the players make in this adventure, along with many opportunities for them to fail certain endeavours.
While it may be tempting to gently, and continuously guide the players to the best outcome, TTRPGs are at their best when players are engaged with/understand what's going on, and they're free to act with no guard rails. This means that allowing them to fail is a key component to making an engaging session.
Failure, even if it happens only once, communicates to the players clearly that if they want to win they need to engage. And when the players know failure is on the cards, victory's become a hell of a lot sweeter.

Allow the players to get in over their head. Allow them the freedom to change the conditions of the test; and finally, allow them to succeed *or fail* as they would realistically.

Your only job as a DM is to tell the players how the world reacts to their shenanigans; give yourself permission to let the players do what they want to do. Trust me, it makes things so much more engaging for both the players and the DM.

Scenarios in which the players can fail are as follows:

- Finding the corpse of Dalvan in the [[#B3. Svalich Woods (C)]]
- Keeping [[Bildrath Cantemir]] amenable to the party in [[#Bildrath's Fury]]
- Dispersing [[#The Angry Mob]] outside the [[#B5d. The Burgomaster's Mansion (E4)]]
- Defending the barricade in [[#The Siege]] at [[#B5f. The Eastern Barricade]]
- Keeping [[Bildrath Cantemir|Bildrath]] and [[Parriwimple]] alive in [[#The Siege]] at [[#B5f. The Eastern Barricade]]
- Convincing [[Doru]] to resist his vampiric nature in [[#Doru's Trial]]

Scenarios in which the adventure assumes the players will succeed are as follows:

- Meeting and establishing a relationship with [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] at [[#B5a. The Barricade]]
- Meeting and establishing a relationship with [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich]] and [[Ireena Kolyana]] at [[#B5d. The Burgomaster's Mansion (E4)]]
- The players find the excerpt of *Van Richten's Guide to Vampires* in the [[#Rooms at the Mansion]]
- The players successfully hold the line against [[#The Siege]] at [[#B5f. The Eastern Barricade]]
- The players successfully hold the line against the Plague Spreader in [[#Ismark's Last Stand]] at [[#B5g. The Western Barricade]]
- [[Ismark Kolyanovich]] survives [[#Ismark's Last Stand]] at [[#B5g. The Western Barricade]]
- The players agree to escort [[Ireena Kolyana]] in [[#Escorting Ireena]]
- The players agree to help bury [[Burgomaster Kolyan Indirovich]] in [[#The Burial]]

Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil.

You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area.
